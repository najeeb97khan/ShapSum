Attached is the draft agenda for the workshop. This includes
the six papers accepted for the first day, 3 panels, an overview
of the DUC evaluation, and system reports from the DUC participants.
Please look it over and let me know of any changes necessary.
In particular check that the affliations are correct and also
that the author list (for the first day) and the speaker representing
an organization (for the second day) are correct--I had to guess
for the speakers for the second day.
