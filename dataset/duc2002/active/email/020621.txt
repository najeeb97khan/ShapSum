Just a reminder that the DUC notebooks papers are due this Sunday
(or early Monday morning).  There are no length restrictions, no
special formatting.  Please send to Lori in either postscript or
PDF form so she can assemble the notebook and get them to the
printers.  We are up against a printer deadline so we do need them
in.

The content can start with your extended abstract and then add stuff,
like results, analysis, other interesting things you have learned.
