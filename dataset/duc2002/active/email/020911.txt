Hi,
For DUC 2003, we are excited to introduce the improved
DUC home page located at:

<http://duc.nist.gov>

Take a moment to view:
DUC 2002 Papers, available in the Publications
section. 

DUC 2003 Guidelines, where you will find a tentative
schedule as well as refined task, data, and evaluation
definitions.


We hope you find our new site helpful and easy to use.
Your comments are welcome.
