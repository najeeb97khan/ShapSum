Hi,

We've been working on resolving outstanding issues in the
DUC guidelines. <http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/duc/2002.html>

1 the length-adjusted coverage metric for abstracts
2 the coverage metric for extracts
3 questions on summary grammaticality, cohesion, organization
4 which summaries will be exempted from these questions based
  length

Here are the results which, barring major objections, will
become part of the guidelines this week and in some cases will 
be built into the manual evaulation software - SEE.

1 Length-adjusted coverage metric for abstracts:

  Since there has been no objection to the proposed use
  of a weighted arithmetric mean to implement a length-adjusted
  coverage measure, we will use that. You get credit for brevity.
  <http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/duc/duc2002/covbrev.html>

2 Coverage metric for extracts:

- NIST will calculate at least sentence recall. Others may
  want to use the Mead tools to calculate other meassures
  <http://perun.si.umich.edu/clair/meadeval/>

3 Questions on summary grammaticality, cohesion, organization:

- A group of participants has suggested questions on 
  grammaticality, cohesion, and organization. NIST 
  tried to select and revise and arrive at a list of
  manageable size. The list is appended. It still
  needs to be translated to everyday English and
  assessor training materials with examples need to
  be created. 

  ??? One major question for you: How many participating groups
  think they will find the strictly intra-sentence questions 
  (1-5) useful - because their system does more than select 
  and reorder unchanged source document sentences? If no one,
  does, we can remove them.

4 Which summaries will be exempted from these questions based
  length

- We propose that the questions be asked for all abstracts
  except for those with a 10-word target size.


Thanks for your help,
Paul


Here are the questions the assessors will answer about 
each submitted summary without looking at the model 
summary or at the source documents:

W i t h i n - s e n t e n c e   j u d g e m e n t s 

1 About how many capitalization errors are there?
   {0, 1-5, 6-10,  more than 10}

5 About many times are unrelated fragments joined into one sentence?
   {0, 1-5, 6-10,  more than 10}



W i t h i n -   o r   a c r o s s - s e n t e n c e   j u d g e m e n t s
