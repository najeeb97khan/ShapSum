The program committee is still working on the program,
but I thought I'd give you a heads-up on two things.

First, it looks like the workshop will only be
Thursday and Friday (July 11 and 12).  The first day
will have 6 accepted papers from various summarization
projects outside of DUC, plus several panels including
a panel on revising the current roadmap for summarization
evaluation and thinking ahead for next year's DUC.

The second day will start with an overview by Paul Over
on the results of DUC 2002.  Then all the groups who submitted
requests to talk will have time to talk about their
work in DUC this year.  More details to follow on this.
The day will finish up (hopefully before dinner!) with
discussion of what was learned and a look into the various
resources that are currently available for summarization
evaluation.
