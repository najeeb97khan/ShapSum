<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Senate confirmation hearings for President Bush's nominees for ambassadorships have shown mixed results for the administration.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Some nominees like Shirley Temple Black the designated ambassador to Czechoslovakia,</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>sailed through the process.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The nominees for Spain, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand faced strong questioning during Senate committee hearings</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>but were eventually slimly approved.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Democrats and retired diplomats believed</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>that three of the nominees had no real qualifications</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>but were picked because of large money contributions to the Republican Party.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Democrats also had concern about the nominee</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>to be ambassador to Italy.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Senator Jesse Helms and other conservatives objected to one nominee</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>because he was a Democrat</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>and were thought likely to have such strong objections to another</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>that her name was withdrawn.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>That woman was initially picked to be ambassador to Nicaragua</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>since that country was to install a woman as president</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>but the potential objections led to a seasoned Latin American expert being named.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The administration picked Thomas Pickering, the ambassador to the UN</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>to be ambassador to India.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>This selection of a well-known diplomat underscores the administration concern regarding the Indian subcontinent</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>where India and Pakistan, both now nuclear capable,</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>continue to feud over Kashmir.</a>
