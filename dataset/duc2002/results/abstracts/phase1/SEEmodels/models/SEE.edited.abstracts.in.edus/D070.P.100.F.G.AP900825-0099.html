<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A West German newspaper reported</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>that ousted East German leader Erich Honecker will not stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communist country exists,</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>although he could be prosecuted in a united Germany for violation of property laws.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Honecker allegedly used $42 million for stocking a private housing estate for Communist government leaders.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, the investigation is not far enough along</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>to determine whether charges would be filed against Honecker before the East German-West German merger.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>He is under investigation for abuse of power, corruption, harboring terrorists,</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>and issuing shoot-to-kill orders against East Germans escaping to West Germany.</a>
