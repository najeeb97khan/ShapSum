<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Discovery crew deployed the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) on Wednesday</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>but stayed nearby in case there was trouble opening the aperture door.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The door was opened Friday morning,</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>exposing the telescope's finely polished 95.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>When the door opened, however, two of HST's four position- stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Engineers got the gyroscopes back on line,</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>but there were still problems with linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite so the planned release on Tuesday of HST's first test image has been delayed.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Scientific data will follow in a month or two.</a>
