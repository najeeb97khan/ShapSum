<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>At the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Florida, forecasters working 12-hour days monitored Hurricane Hugo using computers and satellites.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>They calculated where it would strike</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>and got emergency operations going in those areas.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Director Bob Sheets appeared on TV all week</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>and credited the ever-present but bothersome media with getting the word out.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A hurricane warning, involving emergency preparations and evacuation plans, costs $50 million.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>So far there were no reports of coastal-area deaths.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>After Hugo's landfall, forecasters relaxed</a>
