<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Hurricane Andrew hit the Bahamas, southern Florida and Louisiana in August 1992 with winds ranging up to 165 miles per hour,</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>killing 2 in the Bahamas, 15 in Florida, and 2 in Louisiana.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The greatest property damage was in Florida</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>where a quarter of a million people were left homeless and 2 million were without power.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Property damage there exceeded $15 billion, most of it uninsured.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>An early estimate set the total cost of the storm to insurers at more than $8 billion,</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>but others forecast a total as high as $20 billion, mainly to U.S. insurers.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>After local officials in Florida criticized delays in delivery of emergency supplies,</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>the White House promised "dramatic" improvement within 24 hours and President Bush ordered troops to Florida.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The U.S. government estimated it would cost $20 billion to $30 billion</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Fortunately Andrew did not hit low-lying New Orleans</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>or off -shore oil facilities along the Gulf coast.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>After the hurricane had passed an article in the "Financial Times" compared Andrew to a crisis in the value of the U.S. dollar</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>which was "blowing itself out" during the course of the hurricane.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The comparison was inept.</a>
