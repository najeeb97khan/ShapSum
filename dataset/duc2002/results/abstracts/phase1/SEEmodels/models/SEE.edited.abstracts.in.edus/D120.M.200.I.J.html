<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In early May elections across Britain, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever,</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>losing 444 seats.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>One editorial claims</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>some Conservatives will link the defeats to Prime Minister John Major,</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>and there is speculation</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>that he could be forced out this autumn.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A former welfare recipient, John Major was elected Conservative Party leader and successor to his mentor Margaret Thatcher</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>when she resigned under pressure in November 1990.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office,</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Major was called by Queen Elizabeth II</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>to form a new government,</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>and it was expected</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>that there would be no significant policy shift.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Major's comment</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>while visiting America a month later that Iraqi troops might have to be "forcibly removed" from Kuwait echoed Mrs. Thatcher's hard- line on the Persian Gulf.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Within a year of winning the general election,</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>his popularity had plunged.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>In the July 1993 Christchurch by-election the Conservative majority of 23,015</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>the previous year was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Though Major's personal style is preferable to that of Mrs. Thatcher, he is characterized as a vacillating, weak leader,</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>lacking vision and political conviction.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Not even recent revelations</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>that Major uses salty language can alter his wimp image.</a>
