<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San Francisco,</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>many scientists believed</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>the next "big one" would strike the Los Angles area.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Their studies gave various interpretations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>of how much stress was released by the 1906 earthquake (magnitude 8.3).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The greater the quake, the more stress it relieves</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>and, thus, the longer it takes for the same size quake to occur again.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In the face of conflicting evidence, the US Geological Survey issued a 1988 report</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>that concluded the 1906 quake didn't release as much stress in the San Francisco region as believed. The 6.9 quake Tuesday confirmed the USGS study.</a>
