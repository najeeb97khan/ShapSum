<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The cities of Charleston, SC and San Francisco have similarities and differences</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>when they were the scenes of two back-to-back disasters:</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Charleston had warning</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>but San Francisco did not.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Charleston's neighborhoods were littered with debris,</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>80% of the buildings were damaged,</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>and power was out.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>San Francisco's streets were passable within a day and power was restored overnight.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Charleston, however, in contrast to San Francisco, could quickly assess structural damage</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>and it lost no major economic area such as the Bay Bridge.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Both have experienced delays in disaster relief from the federal government.</a>
