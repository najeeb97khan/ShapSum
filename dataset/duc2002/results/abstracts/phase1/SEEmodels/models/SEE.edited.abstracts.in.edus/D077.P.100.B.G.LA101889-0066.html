<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Tuesday's earthquake, the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the 1906 San Francisco quake, came in a place scientists identified in 1988 as the most likely in Northern California within the next 30 years.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The 1988 report cited probabilities for major temblors along the San Andreas in central and southern California,</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>but pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the most vulnerable partly because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Pressure was probably building up in the neighboring southern segment of the San Andreas,</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>which had not slipped as much since 1906.</a>
