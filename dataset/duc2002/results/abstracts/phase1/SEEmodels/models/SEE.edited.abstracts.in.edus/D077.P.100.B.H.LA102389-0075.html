<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Charleston and San Francisco are united by suffering two of the century's costliest, back- to-back natural disasters, Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Both endured disruption of normal life, destroyed buildings, billions in damages, loss of life, and frustrating delays in getting federal assistance.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The two disasters were different</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>because Hugo gave Charleston warning.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Its damage was everywhere, over quickly, and immediately evident,</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>whereas earthquakes leave hidden damage and have aftershocks.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Charleston recovered slowly</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>and disrupted communications left it isolated.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>San Francisco's earthquake was reported immediately</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>and the city bounced back quickly.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Charleston lost no major lifeline like the Bay Bridge.</a>
