<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>John Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years,</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>taking care of his son, Sean,</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>and, admittedly out of songwriting ideas.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But, in 1980, he again felt inspired</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>and returned to the studio</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>to make an album.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Musicians who worked with Lennon on what were to be his final two albums considered him to be a hero.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Songs that the former Beatle wrote for these albums were mostly mainstream pop; no political anthems.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>He was a happy man; his singing was higher and sweeter than before.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>He wrote songs</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>that were tributes to his wife, Yoko Ono,</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>and to Sean.</a>
