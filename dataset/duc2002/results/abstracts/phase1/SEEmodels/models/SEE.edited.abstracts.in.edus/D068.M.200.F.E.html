<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Checkpoint Charlie, the most famous symbol of the Cold War was lifted into history today.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>At an invitation only ceremony attended by the foreign ministers of the four World War II allies,</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>a U.S. army band played an old Berlin song</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>as the checkpoint was hoisted onto a waiting flatbed truck, to be taken to a museum.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Speaking at the ceremony, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit Berlin,</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>called for the removal of Berlin's status as an allied controlled city and the withdrawal of troops six months after the two German states unify.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Secretary of State James Baker,</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>citing Checkpoint Charlie's status as a Cold War symbol,</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>expressed the hope</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>that its removal would bury the conflicts it created.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The decision to remove Checkpoint Charlie came as large sections of the wall were being dismantled</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>and the opening of the border between the two Berlins made the checkpoint superfluous.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Its removal was timed to coincide with a meeting of German and Allied foreign ministers in East Berlin</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>to discuss the status of Berlin and a united Germany.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Among the invited guests was West Germany's Chancellor Willy Brandt who was mayor of Berlin in the 1960s.</a>
