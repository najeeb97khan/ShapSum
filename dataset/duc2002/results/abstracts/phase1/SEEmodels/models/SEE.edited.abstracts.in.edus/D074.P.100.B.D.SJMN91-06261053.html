<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Clarence Thomas completed five grueling days of Senate questioning apparently well on his way</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>to becoming the second black justice in the history of the Supreme Court.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Several committee members said</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>that they expected the committee to recommend by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote,</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>to confirm.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Several liberal Democrats accused Thomas of being evasive and of disavowing many statements he made</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>while an official of the Reagan and Bush administrations.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The American Bar Association evaluation committee told the senators</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>that Thomas' articles were deficient in presentation, content, scholarship and analysis.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>But those limitations were outweighed by his performance on the Court of Appeals.</a>
