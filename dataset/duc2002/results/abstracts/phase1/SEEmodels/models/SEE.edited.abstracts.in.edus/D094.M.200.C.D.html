<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Emperor Hirohito of Japan died in 1989 at the age of 87.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>He ascended to the throne in 1926</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>and presided over one of Japan's most tumultuous eras.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The last of the World War II generation of leaders, Hirohito was a controversial figure, even in death.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>While many western leaders praised him,</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>many Asian leaders,</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>whose countries suffered under the Japanese military during World War II were cool.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>While most historians believe</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>that Hirohito was a powerless figurehead,</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>others believe that he had to have known of the massacre of thousands of Chinese in Nanking and of the plan</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>to bomb Pearl Harbor.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Some believe that the U.S. covered up his complicity in war crimes after the war</a>

<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Hirohito announced Japan's surrender in a radio address to his nation.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>After the war,</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Hirohito was just a symbol</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>but the imperial system has remained important to the Japanese people.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Hirohito had traveled in Europe</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>and had a preference for Western food and clothes.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>With few real responsibilities,</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>he spent much time in the study of marine biology.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>He died of cancer after a long illness</a>
