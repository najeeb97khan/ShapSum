<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>the shuttle Discovery soared into space</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>to launch its history-making payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Named</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>after the American astronomer Edwin Hubble</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>who did pioneering work</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>leading to the "Big Bang" concept of the universe,</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>it is NASA's most expensive spacecraft.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>While orbiting at 380 statute miles above Earth during its expected 15-year working lifetime,</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>it will provide astronomers world-wide with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Free of Earth's distorting atmosphere, it may be able to look back almost to the beginning of time.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The telescope's release from the shuttle Discovery came two hours and one orbit later than planned.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>A troublesome solar power panel took three tries before it fully unfurled, causing the delay.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Two Mission Specialists astronauts were standing-by to unfurl the panel manually if necessary.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Then more start-up problems, ground controllers were unable to link up the telescope's two high-gain antennas with their assigned relay satellite.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>A weaker back-up antenna system is working.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The telescope was placed on special flight modes</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>until these start-up problems are resolved.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Confident that the Hubble will soon be operational,</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>the shuttle Discovery is preparing to return home.</a>
