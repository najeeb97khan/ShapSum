<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>NEW YORK -- An experiment with more than 1,700 high blood pressure patients showed that a blood and urine test can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But the seven heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidence of heart attacks among the patients, 13 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years of observation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The experiment hints these drugs might also protect patients from heart attacks.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Studies are under way to see if these ACE inhibitors protect patients against heart attacks as well as lower their blood pressure.</a>
