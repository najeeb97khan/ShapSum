Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panel's chairman said he feared Secchia might ``embarrass the United States'' because of his ``penchant for making gross remarks''.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>, and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>, voted ``present,'' meaning they took no position.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>But he said that since Secchia is ``the president's choice'' he would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it.</a>
