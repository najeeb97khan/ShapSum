<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began digging into "The Lives of John Lennon," his first move was to mail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Goldman, whose past tell-all biographies dealt with Elvis Presley and Lenny Bruce, remains unmoved by the hue and cry from the music industry, from Ono and from Lennon's Beatle buddy, Paul McCartney.</a>
