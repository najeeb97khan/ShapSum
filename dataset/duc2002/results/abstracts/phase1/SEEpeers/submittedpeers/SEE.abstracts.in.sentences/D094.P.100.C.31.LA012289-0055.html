<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The death of Emperor Hirohito finished the list of political and military leaders of the World War II era, one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of history on either the European or Asian continents.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>I found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age, in his position, in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring countries.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>I only wish that the soul of Emperor Hirohito be ready to face the ultimate justice when he meets with the waiting souls of millions of innocent men, women and children who were tortured and murdered in his name during the war.</a>
