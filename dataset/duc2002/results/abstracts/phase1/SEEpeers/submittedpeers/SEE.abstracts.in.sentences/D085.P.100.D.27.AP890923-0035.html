<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The ``greenhouse effect'' may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger than Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, some meteorologists say.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mph winds this past week, killing at least 41 people.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore up the Caribbean last year, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when its winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.</a>
