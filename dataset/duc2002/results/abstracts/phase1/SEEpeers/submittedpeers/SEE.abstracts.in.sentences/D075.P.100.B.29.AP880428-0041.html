<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today concludes.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>They found that these people had no unusual complications, got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>``It was an extraordinarily safe strategy,'' said Dr. Eric J. Topol, the study's director.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>``There were no problems with any serious events''.</a>
