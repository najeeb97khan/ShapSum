<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the Bombay stock exchange on Friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken concrete in one of 13 explosions which rocked the city and left at least 255 people killed and over 1,200 injured.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Those were caused by a traditional mix of crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Friday's outrage, by contrast, bears the deadly stamp of high-technology terrorism, complete with Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers, efficient organisation and money.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But these suggestions were seen in Bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspects Moslem extremists who might have taken revenge for the riots which hit India after the Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2,000 dead, including 700 in Bombay.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For the moment, such concerns seem remote from the streets on Bombay, where the atmosphere yesterday was calm.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Businessmen estimated the main loss to the city would be the loss of life and injuries and the damage caused to blasted buildings.</a>
