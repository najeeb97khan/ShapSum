<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Walt Disney Co. filed suit in Los Angeles federal court Thursday against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, charging copyright infringement of its Snow White character and unfair competition.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>"We were therefore greatly surprised and dismayed when we viewed last evening's Academy Awards ceremonies to see that our Snow White character had been used extensively without our permission".</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>At that point, the Disney statement said, the academy, "through a legal representative, denied to Disney that the Academy Award program contained any material deleterious to the interests of Disney, without revealing the academy's intention to feature Disney's Snow White".</a>
