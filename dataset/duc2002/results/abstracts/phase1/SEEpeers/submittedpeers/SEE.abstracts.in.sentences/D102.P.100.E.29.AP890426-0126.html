<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Miss Ball died of a ruptured aorta at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Wednesday morning, hospital officials said.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>``She was old and, of course, I knew about the heart attack, so I was not shocked by her death,'' said Keith Thibodeaux, who at age 6 began playing Miss Ball's drum-playing son on the comedy series that continues in syndication around the world.</a>
