<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Krenz, who had responsibility for many internal security functions before Honecker's ouster, criticized the use of force during his testimony on Jan. 16, 1990.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>"From on Jan. 18, 1990's viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was no general Politburo discussion about the negative developments then taking place in society," said Krenz, an influential Politburo member even before Honecker's fall.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Krenz said he accepted "joint responsibility for misjudging dissident citizens and dissident groups for years".</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Like Krenz, Schabowski denied any personal responsibility for the orders to attack the demonstrators in the capital.</a>
