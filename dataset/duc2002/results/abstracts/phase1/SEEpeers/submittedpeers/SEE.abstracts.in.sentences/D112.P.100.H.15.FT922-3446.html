<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Mr Rechsteiner yesterday broke the silence he has maintained since Robert Maxwell's death in November on the subject of his relationship with the Maxwell family.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>He also stressed that ownership of the MCC shares no longer rested with Robert Maxwell once they had been received by Yakosa: 'Yakosa is owned by the Maxwell Foundation,' he said.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Mr Rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the Maxwell Foundation, which is based in Liechtenstein, but said it was neither Robert nor Kevin Maxwell.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The FT has however obtained documents showing that Mr Kevin Maxwell was closely involved in the process of paying for 25m MCC shares on behalf of two Swiss trusts, Yakosa and Servex.</a>
