<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Hubble Space Telescope orbited with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame communications problems and lifted its lens cover, but its electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The shuttle trailed 50 miles behind Hubble when the aperture door opened 380 miles above Earth, but passed 3.7 miles beneath the telescope later in the day.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Terry said Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the master of its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>From its orbit high above Earth's distorting atmosphere, the telescope will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe.</a>
