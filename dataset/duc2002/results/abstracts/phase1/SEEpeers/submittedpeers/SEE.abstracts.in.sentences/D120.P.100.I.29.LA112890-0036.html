<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>John Major, the 47-year-old chancellor of the exchequer who rose out of one of London's toughest neighborhoods and the unemployment line, was selected Tuesday as Britain's next prime minister. The three-way race took shape last week when Thatcher, stunned by Heseltine's strong showing in the first-round voting for party leader, resigned . But as party members began preparing themselves for a Thursday runoff between Major and Heseltine, the runner-up, both Heseltine, with 131 votes, and Hurd, with 56, threw their support to Major . Thatcher said she was "thrilled" by Major's victory, adding that he was her personal favorite among the three contenders .</a>
