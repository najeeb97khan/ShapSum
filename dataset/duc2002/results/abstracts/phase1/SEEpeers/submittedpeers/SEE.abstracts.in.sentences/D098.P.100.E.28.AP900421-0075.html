<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Two weeks after a failed launch attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The countdown began Saturday afternoon for a launch set for 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If the launch goes on schedule and all else goes well, the first picture from Hubble could be available next weekend.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Nothing, at least scientifically, seems to have been lost as a result of the two-week wait, one of numerous delays plaguing the mission since its original 1983 launch date.</a>
