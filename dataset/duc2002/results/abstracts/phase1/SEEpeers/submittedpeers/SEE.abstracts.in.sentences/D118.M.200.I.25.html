<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Tower, and investigated exhaustively by the FBI, were flimsy.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Yet he waved them about anyway.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, issued a terse statement on Feb. 27, 1989 supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower but refused to comment on a published report that he told Senate Armed Services Committee leaders that Tower used to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Tower's qualifications for the job -- intelligence, patriotism and past chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee -- the nomination should have sailed through with flying colors.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Instead it sank like the Bismarck.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combest's statement about Tower's drinking habits in the 1970s came down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, "like a ton of bricks" and was a factor in Nunn's opposition to the nomination.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Tower had not been a Reagan man he had supported Bush for the 1980 nomination.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>And the Reagan White House went to some lengths to rule the senator out of the job he sought, declaring that the new president would not be nominating any Senate Republican for any Cabinet post.</a>
