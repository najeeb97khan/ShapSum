<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief Sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flower-draped body of Andrei D. Sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described as his country's conscience.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So many people wanted to see Sakharov's body lying in state that authorities extended the viewing period by four hours and moved the coffin so two rows of mourners could file past.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Four pages were filled with pictures of him, condolence telegrams from exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn and President Bush and a text of Sakharov's last public remarks, a speech he delivered hours before his death in which he said the Soviet hierarchy was ``leading the country to a catastrophe''.</a>
