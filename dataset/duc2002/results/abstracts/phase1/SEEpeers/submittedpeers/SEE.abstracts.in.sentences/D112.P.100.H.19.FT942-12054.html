<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US - based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The writs say that Goldman and Sheinberg 'made no reasonable effort to determine who had actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the shares be sold and where the more than Dollars 47m in proceeds from the transfer of the 12.5m shares should go'.</a>
