<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Mr Basil Brookes, MCC's former finance director, has described his shock to the FT at discovering last August that MCC had failed to settle foreign currency transactions with about 20 banks on time.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>On a number of occasions, MCC received the currency, but did not make the payment - thereby giving itself an unauthorised loan.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>NatWest was upset three weeks later when it provided funds - less than Pounds 100m - to the Maxwell empire on the understanding that it would be repaid the same day, and then found that repayment was not made.</a>
