<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Moldavia, acting to defuse one of the Soviet Union's most explosive ethnic conflicts, agreed Sunday to comply with a Kremlin order to reconsider its law making Moldavian the republic's official language.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Gorbachev also gave the republic 10 days to dissolve a new national guard and to come up with measures guaranteeing equal rights for all ethnic groups within its borders.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Gorbachev said the declaration of the Gagauz and Dniester republics was illegal under the Soviet and Moldavian constitutions, as were elections to form legislatures and any actions by those bodies.</a>
