<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A flood peak occured in Bei Jiang in Guangdong's Sanshui at 0400 on 20 June, raising the water level to 10.39 meters -- the largest flood level ever recorded.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Drops in water levels in Guangdong's Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang do not mean that Guangdong's flooding situations have eased, because flood waters in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang will remain at high levels for quite long a period and will enter the sea after the two flood waters jointly flow through the low-lying Zhujiang Delta.</a>
