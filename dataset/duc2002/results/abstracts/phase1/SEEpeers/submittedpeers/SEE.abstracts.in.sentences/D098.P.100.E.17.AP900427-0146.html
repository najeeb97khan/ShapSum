<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Hubble Space Telescope orbited with the big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame communications problems and lifted the lens cover, but the electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Except for a tiny wedge opening, the lens cover had been closed and the telescope blind ever since Hubble was released by the astronauts Wednesday.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Hubble's 10-foot aluminum aperture door was opened to the heavens at 10:30 a.m. EDT EDT, nearly four hours later than planned, exposing its finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for the first time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Terry said Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be `` the master of its own destiny '' in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The shuttle trailed 50 miles behind Hubble when the aperture door opened 380 miles above Earth, but passed 3.7 miles beneath the telescope later in the day.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, for whom the telescope is named, provided the basis for the Big Bang theory of creation.</a>
