<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as defense secretary, delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his term.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Senate's 53-47 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate focused on Tower's drinking habits, behavior toward women and his business dealings with defense contractors.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It was only the ninth time in 200 years that the Senate has voted to reject a president's Cabinet choice and the only time it has done so early in a new administration.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>``It must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and the national security adviser, any number of congressmen and senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on the tip of their tongue,'' Fitzwater said.</a>
