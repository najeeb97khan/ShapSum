<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200,000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions, in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Anglo American Corp., the huge South African mining house, warned against a strike, saying miners had received a good wage increase in July and wouldn't gain further raises by a job action.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>"Our union is at the same time in dispute with a number of other companies, where strike action could take place at any time, should the various mine managements refuse to accede to our members' demands".</a>
