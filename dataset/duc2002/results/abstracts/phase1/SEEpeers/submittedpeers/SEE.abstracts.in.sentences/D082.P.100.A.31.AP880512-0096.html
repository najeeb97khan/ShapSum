<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A Soviet newspaper has painted a highly sympathetic portrait of Andrei D. Sakharov and Yelena Bonner, countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as traitors by the state-run media.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But the account in Moscow News only indirectly mentioned the nearly seven years Sakharov spent in forced internal exile for criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, indicating that topic is still too sensitive.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News said.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Sakharov has been quoted numerous times by Soviet media since his return from exile, but the article in Moscow News was the longest devoted to him so far.</a>
