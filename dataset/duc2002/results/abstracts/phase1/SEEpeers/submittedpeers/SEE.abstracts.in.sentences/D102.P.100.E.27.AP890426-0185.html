<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Lucille Ball, the daffy comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy but delighted viewers for four decades, died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The actress, star of the hugely popular ``I Love Lucy'' and related situation comedies seen in more than 80 countries, had undergone major heart surgery April 18.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Miss Ball's real, onscreen pregnancy marked a milestone in television, and an estimated 44 million viewers _ more than for the inauguration of President Eisenhower _ tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953, to watch Lucy Ricardo have Little Ricky.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and Arnaz signed an $8 million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with CBS in 1953 _ the largest in television history at the time and a figure scarcely any TV star can touch today.</a>
