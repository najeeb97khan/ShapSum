<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A ROW has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock market, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers' books.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Sebi has accused stockbrokers of flouting the exchange's rules, including regulations on margin trading designed to limit the risk of members defaulting through excessive speculative investments.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The argument will do nothing to restore investors' faith in the stock market where, as measured by the Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early last year, including a 320 points fall since the government's budget was announced two weeks ago.</a>
