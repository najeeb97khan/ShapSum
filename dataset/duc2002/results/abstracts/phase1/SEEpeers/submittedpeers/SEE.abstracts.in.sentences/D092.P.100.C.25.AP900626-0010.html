<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Americans who rushed to donate money to help victims of the Armenian earthquake 18 months ago are responding more slowly to the week of June 19, 1990's killer earthquake in Iran.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But relief agencies said they expect contributions to pick up.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>"There's a hierarchy of responsiveness," said Dick Colenso, associate executive director of World Concern, a private relief agency based in Seattle.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Colenso said, however, that contributions will "surge upward" as news spreads of the earthquake's destruction.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>At least 50,000 people were reported killed and 200,000 injured in the earthquake that struck on June 20, 1990.</a>
