<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life: He was to play on John Lennon's new album.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>"His personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever heard about John Lennon," said Newmark, who still lives in New York and works with former Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Newmark spent just one month in the studio, playing on the songs that eventually ended up on "Double Fantasy" and "Milk and Honey," Lennon's final albums.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Once recording began, Lennon was just a "working musician" with the same goal as everyone else: finishing the album.</a>
