<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist, composer, conductor and teacher and was, as well, the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra, often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, while conducting from the piano.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Exhibiting remarkable talent and expertise in four areas that most artists wish they possessed in merely one, Bernstein still might have remained an obscure musician without the unique theatrical flair that dominated his personal as well as professional life.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>At Harvard University, Bernstein studied piano and composition, but developed a serious interest in composing only after meeting American composer Aaron Copland.</a>
