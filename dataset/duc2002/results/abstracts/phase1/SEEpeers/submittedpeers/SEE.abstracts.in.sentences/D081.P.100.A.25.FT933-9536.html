<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Coalminers from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike, pressing the government for higher wages.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Mr Cosma's motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, Cosma has the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Mr Cosma, however, appears confident.</a>
