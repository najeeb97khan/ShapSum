<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The image of a dour, shoeless English boy and his absent, carefree mother prompted Julia Baird and Geoffrey Giuliano to collaborate on a book.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Giuliano's text reads like oral history, as if a British schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across the reader's knees to boast about her brother, the musician.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The end of the book describes what Baird calls Lennon's desire to regain his lost Liverpool roots, when she and her step-brother exchanged letters and phone calls during 1975-80.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Also shown the door was Albert Goldman, whose sordid biography, ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' hit bookstores about the same time as Baird's book.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>``Most people, including Goldman, write books based on other books that have it all wrong''.</a>
