<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is ``totally fiction,'' Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' which presents the ex-Beatle as a violent, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The book has already drawn angry responses from friends of Lennon and Ono McCartney, who contradicted one anecdote involving Lennon smashing a painting in Paul's home, has urged a boycott of the book.</a>
