<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake that left an estimated 25,000 people dead in northern Iran.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>And devastating quakes are not new to the country.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But subsequent reports, some a few minutes apart, said the damage must have been principally to crops, with brief mentions that many casualties were feared in Zanjan and Gilan provinces.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The only detail reported for hours was that, when the quake hit, Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup soccer match between Brazil and Scotland.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The radio, like the agency, also kept listeners informed about the areas hit and the number of casualties.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The television's first shots from the stricken north were screened 12 hours after the quake with no comment from reporters.</a>
