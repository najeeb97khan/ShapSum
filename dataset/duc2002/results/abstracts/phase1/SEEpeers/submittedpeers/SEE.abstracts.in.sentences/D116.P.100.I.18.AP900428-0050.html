<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health.</a>
