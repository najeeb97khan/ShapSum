<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Dan Quayle is likely to be a ``man on the outside'' in George Bush's White House following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, experts say.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Democrats portrayed Quayle during the campaign as a lightweight, a man with little or no legislative accomplishments, untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But Quayle comes to the White House with ``a very damaging stereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in the political community and that's believed by a large segment of the electorate,'' Ornstein says.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Both Barilleaux and Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution see parallels in Quayle's vice presidency and those of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>``Dan Quayle owes his political life to one man and one man alone,'' Mahe says.</a>
