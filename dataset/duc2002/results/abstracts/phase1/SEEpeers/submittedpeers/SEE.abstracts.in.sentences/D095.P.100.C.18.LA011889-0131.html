<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Patrick Edward Purdy, who turned a powerful assault rifle on a crowded school playground Tuesday, killing five children and wounding 29 more, had been a student at the school from kindergarten through third grade, officials said today. Police officials said they still had not determined what set off Purdy, a troubled drifter in his mid-20s with a history of relatively minor brushes with the law . "I don't understand why, and I probably won't ever know why," said Purdy's grandmother, 63-year-old Julia Chumbley, who lives nearby in Lodi .</a>
