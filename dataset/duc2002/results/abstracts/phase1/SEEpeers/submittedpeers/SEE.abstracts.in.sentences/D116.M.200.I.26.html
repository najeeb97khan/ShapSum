<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(04/22/1990) Discovery's five astronauts returned on 04/22/1990 for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(04/24/1990) Five astronauts boarded Discovery on 04/24/1990 for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(04/25/1990) After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on 04/25/1990 and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(04/25/1990) The space shuttle Discovery brought a thundering end to years of frustration when it blasted off on 04/24/1990 to extend human vision to the very edge of the universe.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(04/25/1990) The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles, where its crew on 04/25/1990 will ever-so-carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, billed as the finest optical instrument ever created, a $1.5-billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(04/25/1990) The Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope one orbit late on 04/25/1990 after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a stuck solar panel, narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk.</a>
