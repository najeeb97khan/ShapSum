<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, saying ``nationalist passions'' benefit opponents of his reforms.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Tass said that after Gorbachev noted that ``nationalist passions benefit all anti-perestroika forces,'' he suggested increasing accountability in Soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republics, a law on ``equal use'' of the more than 100 languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the country's republics and regions.</a>
