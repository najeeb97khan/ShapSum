<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell said Monday that he is involved in negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper valued "in the hundreds of millions of dollars".</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Maxwell declined to identify the newspaper, but his comments prompted industry speculation that it might be Gannett's USA Today, Tribune Co.'s New York Daily News or the Chicago Sun-Times.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some analysts said it might make sense for Maxwell to try to purchase USA Today, since it would mesh well with his efforts to print and distribute his month-old "pan-European" English-language paper, The European, in this country.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Maxwell has already been in negotiations with USA Today officials about printing the paper for U.S. distribution.</a>
