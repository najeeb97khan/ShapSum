<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is ``totally fiction,'' Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It's a very dramatically described something, but it's not about John,'' Ono said Wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ono refuted virtually all of these charges, and countered through taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that Goldman's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The book has already drawn angry responses from friends of Lennon and Ono McCartney, who contradicted one anecdote involving Lennon smashing a painting in Paul's home, has urged a boycott of the book.</a>
