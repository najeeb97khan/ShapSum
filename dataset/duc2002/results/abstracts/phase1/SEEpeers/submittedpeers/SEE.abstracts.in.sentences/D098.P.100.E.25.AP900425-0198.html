<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Apr. 24, 1990 and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 7 a.m. EDT when he grasped it with Discovery's 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12-ton telescope high above the shuttle.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>On Apr. 23, 1990, Discovery finally blasted into space, transporting Hubble out of this world and in search of others.</a>
