<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn, making it the world's largest retailer in terms of revenues, and the Walton family probably America's richest.</a>
