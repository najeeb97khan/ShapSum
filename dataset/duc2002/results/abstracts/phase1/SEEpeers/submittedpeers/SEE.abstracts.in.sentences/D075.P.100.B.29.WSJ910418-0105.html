<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>NEW YORK -- An experiment with more than 1,700 high blood pressure patients showed that a blood and urine test can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The experiment suggests that doctors could test their patients with mild to moderate high blood pressure to determine how intensively they should be treated to prevent heart attacks, researchers said.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The patients' high blood pressure was initially discovered in a screening program carried out by Michael H. Alderman and his colleagues at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who operate a work-site blood pressure control program in cooperation with local unions.</a>
