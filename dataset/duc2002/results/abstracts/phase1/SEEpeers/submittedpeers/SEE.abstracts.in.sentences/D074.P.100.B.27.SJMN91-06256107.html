<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>But the panel's traditional third swing vote, Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>, said Thomas was doing well.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Heflin cited the "appearance of a confirmation conversion" and said it may raise questions of Thomas' "integrity and temperament."; But Heflin added, "I am not at this time of any firm opinion one way or the other" on whether Thomas should be confirmed.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>And Simon said Thomas' performance thus far "has neither helped him nor hurt him."; Specter blamed fellow committee members more than Thomas in concluding, "We really haven't moved very far in the process."; Thomas, a black federal appeals judge, was picked by President Bush to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall, the high court's only black justice.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>DeConcini said he thought the conservative Thomas "handled the privacy questions very well" without taking a stand on abortion.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To give such an answer, he said, "would undermine my ability to sit in an impartial way on such an important case."; Thomas, who sat alone at the witness table with no notes or reference materials, also claimed a lack of familiarity with the subject matter when asked about some of his former speeches and articles.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>That moved committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>, to give Thomas a stack of the judge's past speeches so the nominee could "help me understand them" during future questioning.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Thomas, testifying calmly but warily, did offer fuller comment on another hot issue before the high court: prayer in public schools.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>After Simon discussed the feelings decades ago of a Jewish elementary schoolboy who left the room each day while his classmates recited a prayer, Thomas said, "Any policy of exclusion should be considered inappropriate."; Outside the hearing room, abortion-rights advocates said Thomas should not be allowed to disavow past comments they say show he would vot! e ! ! ! to ban most, if not all, abortions.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>"His most unimpressive testimony poses two equally disturbing possibilities: he is either willfully misleading the committee about his views to win confirmation, or he is a man whose convictions have shallow roots," said Arthur Kropp of People for the American Way.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>, said he could not understand how Thomas' prior statements touching on the 1973 abortion decision could have been made without considering its content.</a>
