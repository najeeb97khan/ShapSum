<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Yet when I heard about this, my mind immediately went back to an incident a few months ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre of the US steel industry, as part of his American tour.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major himself, can be all things to all people.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>No, Major's technique is very much his own invention, very much a reflection of his own particular character, itself a product of his unsettled family background.</a>
