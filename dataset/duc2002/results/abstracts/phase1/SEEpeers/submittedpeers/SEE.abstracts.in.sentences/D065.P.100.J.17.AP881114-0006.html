<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Dan Quayle is likely to be a `` man on the outside '' in George Bush's White House following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, experts say.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>`` Dan Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the Bush campaign.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>... Dan Quayle has no friends in a Bush White House except George Bush, '' Barilleaux says.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies, Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has few intimates or allies.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access to the same papers, information and intelligence that is available to the president.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst being his garbled explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, `` I didn't live in this century ''.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>`` however, Quayle has four years to prove himself, and I think you 're going to see stories in two years about how much he's learned's learned, how much he's acted responsibly, how far he's come from the campaign of 1988 ''.</a>
