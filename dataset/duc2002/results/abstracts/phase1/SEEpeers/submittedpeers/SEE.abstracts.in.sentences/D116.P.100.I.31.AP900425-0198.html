<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It started providing power to the telescope's batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before April 10's scheduled liftoff.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>NASA expects to release its first image from the telescope - of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina - on Tuesday.</a>
