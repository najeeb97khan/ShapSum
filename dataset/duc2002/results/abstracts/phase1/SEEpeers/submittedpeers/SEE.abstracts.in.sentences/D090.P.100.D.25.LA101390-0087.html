<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Noble, best known for his long goatee and red stocking cap, quickly surrendered with most of his motley army of soldiers and Higaonon tribal militiamen after two World War II-vintage T-28 planes, called Tora Toras here, bombed and strafed one of the camps.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ironically, Noble made his move on the day a presidential fact-finding board issued a long-awaited 609-page report on the causes of last December's coup attempt in Manila, which left more than 100 people dead.</a>
