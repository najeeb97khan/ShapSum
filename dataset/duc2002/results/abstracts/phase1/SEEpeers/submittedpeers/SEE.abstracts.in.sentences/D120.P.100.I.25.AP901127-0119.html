<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Mrs. Thatcher, ending 11 years in power, intended to submit her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II on Nov. 20, 1990 morning, and Major would then be called to lead the government.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Major's victory ended a patient, four-year campaign by Heseltine to promote himself as a future leader of the party.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Hurd said the party needed to unite, and "John Major is the right leader for this task".</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Hurd and Heseltine conceded within minutes, and party officials declared Major elected.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Heseltine, 57, said Major's election "lays the basis for the unity of our party".</a>
