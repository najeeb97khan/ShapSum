<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty Thursday, 01/18/1990, of molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach, a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal trial in history.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The case ultimately cost taxpayers more than $15 million.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An eight-man, four-woman jury -- 10 of the members parents themselves -- acquitted the Buckeys of 52 counts of molestation after deliberating for nine weeks over evidence that had been presented over the course of more than two years.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The jury reported it was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a mistrial was declared on those allegations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been molested, but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Buckeys were culpable.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Jurors were critical of the prosecutors' methods.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In particular, they cited the prosecution's reliance on videotapes of controversial pretrial interviews of the young witnesses at a Los Angeles child-abuse center.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>They also criticized the Manhattan Beach Police Department's decision, early in the investigation, to send out form letters to parents announcing an investigation had begun and soliciting information.</a>
