<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One year after his election, Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has become dull During his entire campaign for the vice presidency, Quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>That joke was not only funny, but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon: Americans didn't give a damn about the vice presidency (Mike Dukakis tried to make Quayle a major issue and failed), but some also felt that Quayle wasn't qualified for a job that had no qualifications So when Quayle got to Washington, he got there with one goal: Support the President and make himself a very small target.</a>
