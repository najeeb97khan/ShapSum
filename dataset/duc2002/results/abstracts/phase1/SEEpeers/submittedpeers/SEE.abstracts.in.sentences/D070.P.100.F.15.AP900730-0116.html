<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried, the official news agency ADN reported Monday.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>ADN, quoting a Health Ministry statement, said Honecker was still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in January and was not well enough to be incarcerated.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist officials, who had been among Honecker's closest aides, were all fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, ADN said.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Honecker and the seven are charged with corruption and abuse of office.</a>
