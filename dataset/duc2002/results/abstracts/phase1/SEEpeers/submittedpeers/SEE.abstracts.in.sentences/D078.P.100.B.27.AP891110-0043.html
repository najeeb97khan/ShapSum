<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Oscar statuette, one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain, U.S.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said in a ruling released Thursday.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alike made by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, diluted the academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only was an honorary award but also was used to promote the film industry, and therefore did not have a ``limited purpose,'' as required by the copyright act.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette and that the academy's trademark and service marks for the Oscar and the Academy Award names and symbols are unaffected.</a>
