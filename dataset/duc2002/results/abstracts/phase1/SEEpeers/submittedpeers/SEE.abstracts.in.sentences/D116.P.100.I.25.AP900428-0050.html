<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep on Apr. 28, 1990 but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been in a "safe mode" with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Terry said the telescope was running on a "normal control-all mode," where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing.</a>
