<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The visit by human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the U.S.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>That report from Radio Moscow, carried on its international-service news programs Tuesday, apparently was the only mention made by Soviet media of Sakharov's visit to the United States, which began Sunday.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Other activities by Sakharov have gone unreported here, including his delivery to Gorbachev of a list of 200 Soviets reportedly held in prison, labor camp or psychiatric hopsitals because of their political views.</a>
