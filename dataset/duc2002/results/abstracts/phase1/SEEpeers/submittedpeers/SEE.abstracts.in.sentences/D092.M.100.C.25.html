<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Iran said on June 22, 1990 that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington. Iran is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from on June 20, 1990's massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the country's Islamic leadership say.</a>
