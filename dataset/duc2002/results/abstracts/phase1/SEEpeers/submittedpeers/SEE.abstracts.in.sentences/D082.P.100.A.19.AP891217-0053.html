<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Sakharov died Thursday, 12/14/1989, alone in his study at the age of 68, apparently of a heart attack.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>So many people wanted to see Sakharov's body lying in state that authorities extended the viewing period by four hours and moved the coffin so two rows of mourners could file past.</a>
