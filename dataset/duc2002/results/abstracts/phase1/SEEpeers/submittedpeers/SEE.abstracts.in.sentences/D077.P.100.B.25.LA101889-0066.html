The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake .</a>
