<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the first eruption of controversy at a confirmation hearing for a Bush Administration Cabinet nominee, a prominent conservative told a Senate panel Tuesday that John Tower may lack the "moral character" to be secretary of defense.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>"Over the course of many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition -- lack of sobriety -- as well as with women to whom he was not married," conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich told the Senate Armed Services Committee.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Weyrich also told the committee that President Bush's transition team "received hundreds of letters" opposing Tower's nomination, some of which "contain specific allegations of moral impropriety on the part of Mr. Tower".</a>
