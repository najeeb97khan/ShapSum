<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned the nation Saturday night that the country's growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as threatening his program of political and economic reforms.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Appealing for calm and for the cool consideration of grievances after weeks of continuing unrest in scattered areas of the country, Gorbachev made clear the leadership's fear that the nation is heading into a political maelstrom that could tear the Soviet Union apart.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Gorbachev acknowledged that ethnic relations are "wound in a tight knot of contradictions" because of previous Soviet policies, particularly the effort to pull the country's 100-plus ethnic groups into a new "Soviet nationality" with a unified culture.</a>
