<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was lifted into the sky by a giant crane Friday, 06/22/1990, placed gently onto a flatbed truck and consigned to history.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Checkpoint Charlie went up in 1961 in the middle of the Friedrichstrasse boulevard after Communist East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to choke off a flood of refugees to the enclave of West Berlin. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and their colleagues from France, Britain and the two Germanys were to preside over a ceremony marking the checkpoint's removal Friday, 06/22/1990.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze attended the ceremony in a gesture of reconciliation with the Western members of the wartime alliance: Britain, France and the United States . Since East Germany overthrew its Communist government in fall 1989 and the German borders were opened, Checkpoint Charlie has become as superfluous as the crumbling Berlin Wall.</a>
