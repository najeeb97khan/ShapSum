<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5 at 5:41 p.m., just one minute later than Navy officials had estimated.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Twenty minutes later, families started filing aboard the ship, exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship.</a>
