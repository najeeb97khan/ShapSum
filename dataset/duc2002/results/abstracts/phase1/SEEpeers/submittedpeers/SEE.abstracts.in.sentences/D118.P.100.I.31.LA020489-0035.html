<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In its renewed investigation of defense secretary nominee John Tower, the FBI is checking allegations that Tower was recently involved in an episode of public drunkenness, sources said Friday -- allegations that call into question his insistence that he has no current drinking problem.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The bureau already had conducted an extensive background investigation of Tower, a 24-year Senate veteran who headed the Armed Services panel from 1981 to 1985.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>said that the controversy has already hobbled Tower's ability to lead the Pentagon effectively.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Army Times, another prominent defense community publication, says Tower is unsuited for the Defense Department post because of his work as a consultant to defense contractors shortly after leaving government service in 1986.</a>
