<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday 04/25/1990 and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Nothing, at least scientifically, seems to have been lost as a result of the two-week wait, one of numerous delays plaguing the mission since its original 1983 launch date.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million has been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The European Space Agency contributed $250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Astronomers will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15 billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars.</a>
