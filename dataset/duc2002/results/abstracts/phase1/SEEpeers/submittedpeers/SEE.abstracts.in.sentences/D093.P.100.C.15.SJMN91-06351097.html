<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>U.S. Navy aircraft joined the search today for survivors of the ferry sinking that left 471 people missing in shark-infested Red Sea waters but found nothing but empty life rafts and debris.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Investigators, meanwhile, were looking into complaints from some of the 178 survivors that the crew of the Salem Express abandoned ship without helping them into lifeboats or flotation gear.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>They also want to know why the ferry strayed outside standard navigational channels.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>"We are looking for both survivors and bodies," said Brig.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>"We haven't lost all hope that there may be some survivors, although the odds are against it".</a>
