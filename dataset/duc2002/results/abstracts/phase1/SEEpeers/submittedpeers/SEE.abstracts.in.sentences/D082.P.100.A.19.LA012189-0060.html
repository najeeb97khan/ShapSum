<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>During secret balloting Friday, 01/20/1989, at the prestigious Lebedev Institute, the physicists supported Sakharov's candidacy by a vote of 1,543 to 22.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The outcome was more an expression of respect for Sakharov as a man who stuck by his principles during difficult times.</a>
