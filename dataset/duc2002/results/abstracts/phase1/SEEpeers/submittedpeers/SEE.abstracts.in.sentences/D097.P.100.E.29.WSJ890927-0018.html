<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far, but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The property claims service division of the American Insurance Service Group, a trade association, is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The impact on premium rates could be minimal for now, analysts expect, because the biggest losses will be in the personal insurance area -- for homes and autos.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the last three years, hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild, so insurers haven't had to dip into these funds.</a>
