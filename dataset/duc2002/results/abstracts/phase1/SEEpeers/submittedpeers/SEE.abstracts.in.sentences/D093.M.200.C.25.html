<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A series of ferrys happened in Dhaka, India, Saratoga, and other places between Aug. 8, 1988 and Dec. 16, 1991.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Authorities charged a 22-year-old ferry captain with negligent homicide after the boat, overcrowded with New year's travelers, sank off the Caribbean coast.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>On September 22, another overloaded ferry sank in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region bordering Vietnam, leaving 61 people dead and one missing.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The move followed the July 21 capsizing of a ferry on the Min River in Southwestern Sichuan province in which 133 people died, and the July 25 sinking of a passenger boat on the Yangtze River in which 71 people drowned. Officials had yet to determine the exact cause of the sinking, but Giron Arreola said the ferry captain was slow to respond to requests by the skipper of the naval patrol boat to take control of the ferry's wheel once it was under tow.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Investigators were looking into complaints from some survivors that the crew abandoned the ferry without helping passengers and that some crew members pushed aside passengers to get to lifeboats .</a>
