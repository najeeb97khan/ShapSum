<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Among the highlights: Greg Louganis won the Olympic Spirit Award as top American athlete on Oct. 1, 1988 for winning gold medals in platform and 3-meter springboard diving.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>During most of the past Games, "there was enough continuous TV coverage so that, much like a soap opera, it was possible to get involved in the lives and in the competition," says Leigh Steinberg, attorney for ice-skater Brian Boitano, a gold medalist at the 1988 Winter Games.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But not this summer, Steinberg says.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Bush, borrowing a phrase from Ruth Owens, said it was not those athletic feats but "his humanitarian contributions in the race of life" that earned Owens the Congressional Gold Medal.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Earlier in 1988, sports marketers estimated that a gold medal won during the Summer Games could earn a personable athlete more than $1 million in endorsements.</a>
