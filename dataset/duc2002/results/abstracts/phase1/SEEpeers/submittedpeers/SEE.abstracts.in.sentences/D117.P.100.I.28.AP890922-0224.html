<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The award, to be announced Oct. 26, carries a $31,600 prize funded by the Booker McConnell food company.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Oddsmaker William Hill gave 7-to-4 odds on Ishiguro's novel about a butler's travels through Britain's West Country and said it was ``a firm favorite'' to win.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, ``was beaten as the Booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger this time in our view,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe.</a>
