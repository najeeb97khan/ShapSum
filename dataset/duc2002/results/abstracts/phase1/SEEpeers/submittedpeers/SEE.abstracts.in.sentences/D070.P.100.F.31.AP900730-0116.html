<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried, the official news agency ADN reported Monday.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But a medical exam by a team of doctors found him in condition to be questioned and to stand trial, ADN said.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany for 19 years until he was ousted in October as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept the country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist government and the opening of the Berlin Wall.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist officials, who had been among Honecker's closest aides, were all fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, ADN said.</a>
