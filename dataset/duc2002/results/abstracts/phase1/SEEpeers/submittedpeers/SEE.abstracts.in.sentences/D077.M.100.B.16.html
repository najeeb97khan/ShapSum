<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Federal emergency officials have estimated that the next ``big one'' _ a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake _ could kill 3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000 people in the Bay Area.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Although Tuesday's quake was powerful, Waverly Person, chief of the National Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., cautioned that at 6.9 magnitude, it should be considered only a "strong" shock, not a "major" one, as a quake in the 7.0 to 7.9 range would be classified, or a "great" one, as a quake of 8.0 or above would be.</a>
