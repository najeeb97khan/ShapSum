<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In what is fast becoming a pit-bull match, the one owner, Anthony Attalla, is suing the other two, John and Rita Remondi, charging that they have been showing Cory even though he is officially retired (as announced in Dog News).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Mr. Attalla says, "Cory has achieved the pinnacle of success.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>.. and any further competition would only diminish what he has accomplished".</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The Remondis argue that the retirement "fraudulently" deprives them of their opportunity to show Cory, a dog who they assert "is in the best condition of his life".</a>
