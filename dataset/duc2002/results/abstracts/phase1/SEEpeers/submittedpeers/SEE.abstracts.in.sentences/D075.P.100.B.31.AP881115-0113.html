<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The first phase of the study showed that giving people a clot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances of survival.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The latest study, presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association, was intended to see whether people did better still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after giving TPA.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people with clogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks.</a>
