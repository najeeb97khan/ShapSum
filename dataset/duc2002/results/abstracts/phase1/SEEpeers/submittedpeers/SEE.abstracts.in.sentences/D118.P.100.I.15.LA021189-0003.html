<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Senate panel weighing John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary has found a substantial discrepancy in Tower's descriptions of his business dealings with a British aircraft and weapons manufacturer, congressional sources said Friday.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Lawmakers from both parties have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of interest hanging over Tower because of his employment by weapons firms, which brought him at least $760,000 in 2 1/2 years -- not including the more than $200,000 British Aerospace paid him.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Sources said the apparent discrepancy in testimony raises the prospect that Tower could be recalled to testify under oath about his work for the firm.</a>
