<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>More than 10,000 coal miners in four states were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in Virginia and West Virginia who have waged a bitter strike since April against the Pittston Coal Group.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One United Mine Workers representative said today that the Indiana walkout was prompted by Thursday night's telecast of CBS' ``48 Hours,'' which focused on the Pittston strike, in which 1,600 miners have been off the job since April.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>``I would no more try to tell someone else how to run their company than I would expect someone else to try to tell me how to run my company,'' said Robert H. Quenon, president of Peabody Holding Co., the nation's largest coal producer, and chairman of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.</a>
