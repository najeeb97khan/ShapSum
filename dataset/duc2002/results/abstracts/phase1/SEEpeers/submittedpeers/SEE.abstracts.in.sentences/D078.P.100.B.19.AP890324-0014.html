<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>With Oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than $ 10,000 and a Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones, the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is scrambling to make sure Oscar 's golden sheen is n't tarnished by Hollywood hucksterism.</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The Academy had claimed the Lone Star Statuette, designed and built by Chicago's Creative House Promotions, was ``practically identical'' to the Oscar.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The court found otherwise.</a>
