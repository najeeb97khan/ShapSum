<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The most intense hurricane on record surged toward Texas today after battering the Yucatan Peninsula with 160 mph winds, leveling slums, pummeling posh resorts and forcing tens of thousands to flee.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Hurricane Gilbert, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicans homeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the storm was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward the U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, which was measured at 26.31 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.</a>
