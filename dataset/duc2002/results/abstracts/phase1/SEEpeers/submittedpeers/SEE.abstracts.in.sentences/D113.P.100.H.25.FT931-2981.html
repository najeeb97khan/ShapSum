<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>On Mar. 11, 1993 a series of car bombs exploded in Bombay in what the government described as a systematic attack on India's commercial heart.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Police said a bomb exploded in the crowded trade and residential district of Bowbazaar shortly after midnight, causing two blocks of flats to collapse and trapping up to 70 people in the rubble.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Some fear the wave of bomb attacks is designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and undermine efforts by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism.</a>
