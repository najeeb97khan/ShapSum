<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Bentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton pitched in to help check-out clerks at his store in this Florida Panhandle city when an electronic glitch shut down the cash registers.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The 71 -year-old Walton, considered to be one of the world's richest people, grabbed a note pad Tuesday evening and started hand-writing merchandise for customers so their bills could be tallied on calculators quickly.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Sam, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit to the store that later Tuesday staged a concert by country singer Jana Jea in its parking lot.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Forty years after Sam Walton first hung out his shingle, Sam's 5 &amp;amp; 10 will reopen to show how a little rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Sam is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boy who became one of the world's most successful businessmen.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Although Sam built up a small chain of Bentonville Ben Franklin variety store franchises from 1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount store.</a>
