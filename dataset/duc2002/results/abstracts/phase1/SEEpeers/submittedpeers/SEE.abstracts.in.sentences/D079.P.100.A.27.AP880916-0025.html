<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thousands of coastal residents from Mexico to Louisiana fled to higher ground Thursday as fierce Hurricane Gilbert sent the first of its storms against Texas after thrashing the Yucatan Peninsula.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>CDT, the storm center was near latitude 22.8 north, longitude 94.4 west, or about 275 miles southeast of Brownsville, moving west-northwest between 12 and 15 mph, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph and accompanied by a 5- to 10-inch rainfall, according to the National Weather Service.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The weather service issued a hurricane warning for Mexico's northern coast and the southern half of the 370-mile Texas coast from Brownsville to Port O'Connor, including 250,000-resident Corpus Christi.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A hurricane watch remained in effect for the remainder of the Texas coast, from Port O'Connor north to Port Arthur near the Louisiana border.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Clements also issued an emergency proclamation allowing local authorities to suspend laws ``to preserve the health, safety and welfare of the public,'' including such things as the direction of travel on highways.</a>
