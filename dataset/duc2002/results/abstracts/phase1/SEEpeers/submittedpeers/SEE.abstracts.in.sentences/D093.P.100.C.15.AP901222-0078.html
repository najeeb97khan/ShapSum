<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Chief Petty Officer Lance Vickery recalls waves tumbling into the stern of the bobbing ferry headed back to the USS Saratoga and joking, "Whoa, looks like we're flooding".</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Three of the sailors said the boat had been taking on water over the stern in heavy seas, then capsized when it was hit by a big wave.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Vickery said the fatal wave came about a minute after he had cracked his joke.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>"I started breathing in water and almost died," Vickery said.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>"If I had been under the water maybe another 30 seconds, I wouldn't be lying here right now.</a>
