<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as defense secretary, delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his term.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Dole agreed to a late-afternoon vote on the nomination after acknowledging the collapse of a last-minute bid to give Tower an extraordinary six-month trial period as defense secretary to prove he could abstain from drinking.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Names most frequently mentioned in White House speculation as a replacement for Tower if his nomination failed are Sen. Warner, a former secretary of the Navy; former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld; former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.</a>
