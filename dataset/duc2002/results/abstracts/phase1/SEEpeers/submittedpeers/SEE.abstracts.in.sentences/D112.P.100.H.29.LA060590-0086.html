<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell said Monday that he is involved in negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper valued "in the hundreds of millions of dollars". The Daily News has one of the United States' largest circulations, but in recent years it has struggled to restore profitability and maintain circulation in a market with three other dailies.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The paper is conducting difficult labor contract negotiations with its unions . Other industry officials conjectured that Maxwell might be talking to the Chicago Sun-Times, which has seen daily circulation slide more than 100,000 papers, to about 533,000, since 1985 .</a>
