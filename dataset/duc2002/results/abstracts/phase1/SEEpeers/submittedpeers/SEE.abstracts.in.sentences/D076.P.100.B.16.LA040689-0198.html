<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today argued passionately during a four-hour meeting that covered subjects ranging from disarmament to reports of Soviet bomber sales to Libya, officials said. Reopening a European peace offensive that was disrupted by the Armenian earthquake, Gorbachev had "extremely frank exchanges, animated, warm, passionate and solemn," said a Thatcher spokesman, requesting anonymity . The spokesman said Thatcher asked Gorbachev about a report from Washington that Moscow sold up to 15 long-range fighter-bombers to Libya, which Britain accuses of sponsoring terrorism.</a>
