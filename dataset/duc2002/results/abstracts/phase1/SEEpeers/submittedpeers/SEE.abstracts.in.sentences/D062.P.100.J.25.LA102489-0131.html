<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>EARTHQUAKE AFFECTS CALIFORNIA, BAY AREA AND OAKLAND</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of on Oct. 23, 1989's Northern California earthquake.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Deukmejian should be commended, as well, for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape. The governor's answer, which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake, was that no one in Caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake .</a>
