<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began digging into ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' his first move was to mail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters, family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing; it also taught Goldman - who says he is a John Lennon fan - a hard lesson.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Those attacks don't really bother him, unless they come from someone who hasn't read ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' Goldman said.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As for the sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse by Yoko and John, wild drinking binges, anorexia and reclusiveness, Goldman says it all fits together with the image of Lennon presented by those who knew him.</a>
