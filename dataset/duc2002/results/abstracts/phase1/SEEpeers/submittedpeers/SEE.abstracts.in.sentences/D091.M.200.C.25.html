<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A series of floods happened in Ohio, Ohio River, Wegee Creek, and other places between June 15, 1990 and June 18, 1990.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Investigators on June 16, 1990 blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of three bridges over the creeks.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio rose to 20 on June 16, 1990 as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Heavy rain fell for about 45 minutes, swelling Wegee Creek, one of two creeks that overflowed in on June 13, 1990 night's flash flood.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Residents donned shorts and hip-waders on June 14, 1990 to begin putting their lives back together after 5 inches of rain fell in 3 hours late on June 13, 1990, churning floodwaters that left at least 11 people dead and 51 others missing early on June 16, 1990.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In Jefferson County, 50 to 60 residents were evacuated in Adena, where water was 6 to 8 feet deep in streets because of creek flooding.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Deanna Hulderman, 48, said she and her husband, Clancey, were pulled under by Wegee Creek flood water at a bar but were reunited about a half-hour later.</a>
