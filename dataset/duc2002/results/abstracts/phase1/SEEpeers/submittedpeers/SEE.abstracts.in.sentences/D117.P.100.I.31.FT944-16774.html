<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After hours of heated delib-eration - under a system described as 'mad' by one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker judges, acknowledged that Mr Kelman's book in particular might be deemed inaccessible.</a>
