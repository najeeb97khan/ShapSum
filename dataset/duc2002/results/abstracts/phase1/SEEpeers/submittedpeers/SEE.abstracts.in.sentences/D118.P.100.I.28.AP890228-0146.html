<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, issued a terse statement Tuesday supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower but refused to comment on a published report that he told Senate Armed Services Committee leaders that Tower used to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combest's statement about Tower's drinking habits in the 1970s came down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, ``like a ton of bricks'' and was a factor in Nunn's opposition to the nomination.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The newspaper reported that Combest later gave a different story to the FBI, saying that Tower and a group of friends not Tower alone had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch.</a>
