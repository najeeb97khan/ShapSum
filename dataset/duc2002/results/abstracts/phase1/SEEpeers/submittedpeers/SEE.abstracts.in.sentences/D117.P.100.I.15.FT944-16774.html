<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After hours of heated delib-eration - under a system described as 'mad' by one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked: 'James Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is'.</a>
