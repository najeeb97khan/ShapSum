Negroponte, a veteran diplomat who helped direct U.S. aid to Nicaraguan rebels, to the key position of ambassador to Mexico, Administration officials said Thursday. Negroponte, a 28-year Foreign Service veteran, served as U.S. ambassador to Honduras from 1981 through 1985, when the CIA was secretly funding the Contras . But Bush Administration officials said they are confident that the Mexican government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will accept the nomination .</a>
