<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Britain alone have won more relay medals (23) than all the Caribbean islands (nine) and Africa (four, including one for South Africa).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>With a little luck - with their nerve-stretching hand-overs the relays always require a little luck - the developing countries will continue the gentle redistribution of medals.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the 4x100m heats James Jett replaced Carl Lewis but Lewis ran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue his eighth Olympic gold.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Lewis, on the other hand, seemed unsurprised when Mike Powell was unable to overhaul him in the long jump.</a>
