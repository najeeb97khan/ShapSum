<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Tower, conservative Republican senator from Texas, son of a respected Methodist preacher, boozed it up and fooled around.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>John G.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Tower wasn't -- isn't -- St. John the Divine, as he himself acknowledges with semi-charming candor in "Consequences: A Personal and Political Memoir (Little, Brown, 388 pages, $22.95).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Did he deserve, even so, public flagellation as George Bush's defense-secretary nominee?</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>You would obviously expect Mr.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Tower to say no, and he obliges: volubly and passionately.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Politics never has been for the squeamish, but the Tower controversy leaves a much more disagreeable taste than did the senator's caperings (which mostly took place in the '70s anyway).</a>
