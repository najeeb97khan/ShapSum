<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thousands of Americans piled into cars and buses with dogs, cats and duffel bags and left Clark Air Base today after scientists warned that the eruption of a nearby volcano could turn catastrophic.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The decision to evacuate one of the largest overseas U.S. military bases was made early today after searing gases, ash and rock shot out of 4,795-foot Mount Pinatubo on Sunday at speeds of up to 60 mph.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Mount Pinatubo, the Philippine volcano that erupted Saturday after six centuries of quiet, is likely to explode in the next few days or weeks with force comparable to the Mount St. Helens explosion, a U.S. government scientist said Monday.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>" As much as two inches of coarse gray ash and fist-sized pieces of pumice fell along a 50-mile stretch southwest of the volcano.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>An eruption this morning caused an earthquake so strong it "sent seismograph needles off the chart," and registered 60 miles south in Manila, said Jessie Daligdig, a government geologist.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Mount Pinatubo rumbled today with explosions that hurled ash and gas more than 12 miles high, and a typhoon brought heavy rain that could unleash tons of debris from the jagged slopes.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>; The United States refuses to confirm or deny that it stores nuclear weapons in the Philippines.</a>
