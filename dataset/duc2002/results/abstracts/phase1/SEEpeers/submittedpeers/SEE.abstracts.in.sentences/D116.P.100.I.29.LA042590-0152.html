<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope one orbit late today after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a stuck solar panel, narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk. The telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles -- high above the atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based telescopes . Mission Control ordered spacewalking astronauts to be ready to go out of the cabin to help.</a>
