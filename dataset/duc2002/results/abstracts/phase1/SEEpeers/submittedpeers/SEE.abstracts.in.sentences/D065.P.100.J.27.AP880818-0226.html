<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Mr. Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the United States.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there _ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into the law of the land.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>He's got plenty of experience, plenty of experience _ experience in raising taxes again and again, experience in vetoing the pledge of allegiance in public schools, experience in increasing spending year after year after year in Massachusetts.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all Americans and the future of our country.</a>
