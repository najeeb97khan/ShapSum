<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far, but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., which has extensive domestic, foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas Hugo hit, and USF&G Corp. in Baltimore, a big insurer in the Carolina region, could also be forced to take one-time charges against third-quarter earnings, analysts said.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Niagara Exchange Corp., based in Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter, and possibly for the year, because of the substantial losses that its Charleston Insurance Co. unit faces as a result of the hurricane.</a>
