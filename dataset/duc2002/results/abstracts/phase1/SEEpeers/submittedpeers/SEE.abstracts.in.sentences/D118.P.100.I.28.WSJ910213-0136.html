<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Tower, conservative Republican senator from Texas, son of a respected Methodist preacher, boozed it up and fooled around.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>His second made him miserable.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>All the while, he preened himself as the first statewide Republican officeholder since Reconstruction.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Tower wasn't -- isn't -- St. John the Divine, as he himself acknowledges with semi-charming candor in "Consequences: A Personal and Political Memoir (Little, Brown, 388 pages, $22.95).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Did he deserve, even so, public flagellation as George Bush's defense-secretary nominee?</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Politics never has been for the squeamish, but the Tower controversy leaves a much more disagreeable taste than did the senator's caperings (which mostly took place in the '70s anyway).</a>
