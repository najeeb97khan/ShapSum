<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>During his entire campaign for the vice presidency, Quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>That joke was not only funny, but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon: Americans didn't give a damn about the vice presidency (Mike Dukakis tried to make Quayle a major issue and failed), but some also felt that Quayle wasn't qualified for a job that had no qualifications.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>So when Quayle got to Washington, he got there with one goal: Support the President and make himself a very small target.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>And it says something about Dan Quayle's reputation that he would be considered "above and beyond" the usual guest.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>I asked Christie Basham of "Meet the Press" if Quayle had asked in advance who the questioners would be.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(If Quayle had been told the questioners were going to be Hunter Thompson and Jimmy Breslin, I have a feeling Quayle might have come down with laryngitis).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>During the 1988 campaign, I interviewed Quayle and I came away with one overwhelming impression: Dan Quayle would run for President in 1996.</a>
