<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>DAMAGE CAUSED by Hurricane Andrew could rise to Dollars 20bn, it was estimated yesterday, as one of the costliest US storms this century threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of New Orleans.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Government officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas yesterday advised or ordered more than 2m people to evacuate coastal areas.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Several forecasting agencies suggested the likeliest landfall was in central Louisiana, to the west of New Orleans, possibly late last night or this morning.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>New Orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable because the city lies below sea level, has the Mississippi River running through its centre and a large lake immediately to the north.</a>
