<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The ``greenhouse effect'' may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger than Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, some meteorologists say.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore up the Caribbean last year, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new book ``Global Warming,'' said six of the 10 hottest years in the last 100 occurred in the 1980s.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when its winds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the Gulf Stream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.</a>
