<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Dawn broke Sunday over a battle-scarred Tiananmen Square with tanks and rifle-toting troops ruling the vast expanse occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society from their communist rulers.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A low cloud of smoke covered much of the 100-acre square as bonfires set during the night's confrontation continued to smolder.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The battle for Tiananmen was primarily fought in the streets leading to the square, where scores of people fell trying to prevent columns of troops and armored military vehicles from moving on the students.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>At 4 a.m., the lamposts that dot the square went ominously dark, and the student loudspeaker played the Internationale, the socialist anthem.</a>
