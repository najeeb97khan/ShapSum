<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>, said Thomas was doing well.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Heflin cited the "appearance of a confirmation conversion" and said it may raise questions of Thomas' "integrity and temperament".</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>And Simon said Thomas' performance thus far "has neither helped him nor hurt him".</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Specter blamed fellow committee members more than Thomas in concluding, "We really haven't moved very far in the process".</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>DeConcini said he thought the conservative Thomas "handled the privacy questions very well" without taking a stand on abortion.</a>
