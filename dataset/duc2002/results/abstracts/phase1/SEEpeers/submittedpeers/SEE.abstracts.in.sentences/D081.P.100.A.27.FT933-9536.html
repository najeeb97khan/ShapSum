<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike, pressing the government for higher wages.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The Ministry of Industry argues that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produced each year in the Jiu Valley's 13 mines is not a vital source of energy.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The ministry further argues that the miners are in danger of pricing their coal out of the market.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In recent months, Mr Cosma has claimed he has evidence that senior government officials, including President Ion Iliescu, called miners to Bucharest as part of plans to consolidate their own power.</a>
