<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Debi Thomas' dream of Olympic gold turned into disappointment Saturday as East Germany's Katarina Witt won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian Elizabeth Manley took home the silver before a crowd of cheering countrymen.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While the top two skaters in the world staged a shootout to music from Bizet's ``Carmen,'' Manley was so sensational in the freestyle that she finished first with seven judges.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Combined with a fourth in the compulsory figures and a third-place finish in the short program earlier in the week, the performance put Manley in second place.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Witt, a three-time world champion from East Germany, became the first repeat singles champion since Dick Button took Olympic gold in 1948 and '52.</a>
