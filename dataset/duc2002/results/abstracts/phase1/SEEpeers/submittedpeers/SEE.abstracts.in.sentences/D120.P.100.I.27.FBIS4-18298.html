<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Scant Relief to Major"] [Text] Cabinet ministers rallied behind John Major yesterday by insisting there would be no leadership election this autumn.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But the concerted show of support failed to dispel doubts among Tory MPs about his chances of staying in office.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Right-wing MPs confirmed the findings in an INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY/NOP [National Opinion Poll] poll that Michael Heseltine was the favourite to replace Mr Major, if he is forced out.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Some of Mr Major's closest allies were seething with anger at Mr Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, for "posturing" before the damaging retreat last week by the Prime Minister over Britain's veto powers in the enlarged European Union.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The leadership is hoping that over the Easter recess the Conservative constituencies will urge their MPs to stop the damaging in-fighting which they believe is overshadowing the Government's fightback on the economy, law and order and education.</a>
