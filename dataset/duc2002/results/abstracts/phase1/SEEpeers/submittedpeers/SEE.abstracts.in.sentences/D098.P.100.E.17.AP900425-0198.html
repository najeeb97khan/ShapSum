<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on the 15-year search for new worlds.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Discovery was following Hubble in case the door does not open properly.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the sensitivity of its five instruments.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The telescope is named for the late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe was expanding.</a>
