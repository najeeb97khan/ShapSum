<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Krenz, who had responsibility for many internal security functions before Honecker's ouster, criticized the use of force during his testimony Wednesday.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Krenz, who was thrown out six weeks after succeeding Honecker on Oct. 18, insisted he knew nothing about any orders to shoot demonstrators.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Krenz said he accepted "joint responsibility for misjudging dissident citizens and dissident groups for years".</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>"From today's viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was no general Politburo discussion about the negative developments then taking place in society," said Krenz, an influential Politburo member even before Honecker's fall.</a>
