<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Two weeks after a failed launch attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years, they hope to determine the precise origin of the universe and learn whether other solar systems _ and life forms _ exist.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discovery's power system until its energy-collecting solar panels are deployed 380 miles above Earth, the highest a shuttle has ever gone.</a>
