<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Before the hurricane warning system was established, a storm of Hugo's power would have cost thousands of lives.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But early on Sept. 22, 1989, after days of warnings and proper evacuation procedures, there were no immediate reports of deaths despite widespread damage in Charleston and other coastal areas of South Carolina.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>"This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced," warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with renewed fury on Sept. 20, 1989 after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The roof cracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that has withstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water poured into the paneled council chamber.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science.</a>
