<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq and froze the nation's assets in the United States on Thursday while refusing to rule out the use of U.S. troops to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders. The trade embargo bars imports of oil from Iraq, which account for 3% to 4% of total U.S. oil supplies, officials said.</a>

"I think the U.S. intervention at this stage is both paramount and important" .</a>
