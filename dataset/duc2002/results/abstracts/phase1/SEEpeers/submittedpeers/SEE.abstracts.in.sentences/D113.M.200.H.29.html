<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A ROW has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock market, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers' books.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city, killing about 200 people and injuring more than a thousand.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared to be a systematic attack on India's commercial heart.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The bombs appeared designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and to undermine efforts by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Police said a bomb exploded in the crowded trade and residential district of Bowbazaar shortly after midnight, causing two blocks of flats to collapse and trapping up to 70 people in the rubble.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of Bombay.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal.</a>
