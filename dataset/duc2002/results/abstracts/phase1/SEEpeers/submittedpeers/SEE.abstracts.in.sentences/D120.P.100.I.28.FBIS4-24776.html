<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In local government elections across Britain yesterday, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, losing control of 17 regional councils and 444 seats.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As the ruling party, the Tories took just 27 percent of the vote, two percentage points lower than their rating in the polls.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The results of the local elections showed that the Tories were reduced to the third party nationally, behind the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Of course, this was a measure taken by Tories under circumstances of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging constituents, who resent the Tories, to vote for the Liberal Democrats rather than Labour.</a>
