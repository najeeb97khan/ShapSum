<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There was plenty of blame to go around at the end of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, but no one was willing to accept it.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52 child molestation charges.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Robert Philibosian, now in private practice, angrily dismissed accusations that he played up the McMartin case in 1984 - with the news media acting as eager accomplices - to boost his public profile as he ran for district attorney.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Philibosian said Reiner hurt prosecutor's chances by dismissing charges against five of the original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a 1986 ``60 Minutes'' interview.</a>
