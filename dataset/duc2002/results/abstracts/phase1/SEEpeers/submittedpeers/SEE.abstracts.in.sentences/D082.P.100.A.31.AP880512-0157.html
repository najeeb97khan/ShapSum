<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It said one Soviet book accused the Sakharovs of living in ``oriental luxury'' and engaging in ``scandals between spouses''.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Moscow News said Sakharov was stubborn, unassuming, an undisputed member of his country's intelligentsia and a man with his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and the demands of this life.</a>
