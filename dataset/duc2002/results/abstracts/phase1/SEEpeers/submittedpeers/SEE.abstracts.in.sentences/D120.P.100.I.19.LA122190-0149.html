<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>British Prime Minister John Major said today that Iraqi troops will have to be " forcibly removed " from Kuwait if President Saddam Hussein does not agree to withdraw them peacefully.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Major, just as unyielding in talking about Hussein as was his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, rejected the notion that a partial Iraqi pullback from Kuwait would help bring about a solution to the crisis.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Major, who arrived here Thursday night for a 40 - hour visit, wasted no time in going on a rhetorical offensive against Hussein, using a succession of four television interviews aired shortly after dawn.</a>
