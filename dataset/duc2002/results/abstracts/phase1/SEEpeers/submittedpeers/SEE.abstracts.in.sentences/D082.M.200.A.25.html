<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>THE STORY OF ANDREI D. SAKHAROV</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Some statements and articles by Sakharov have been printed in the Soviet media since then, including an article the week of Nov. 2, 1988 in a magazine that opposed some elements of Gorbachev's blueprint for political and electoral reforms.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News said.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>"In effect, sometimes Sakharov bitterly jokes that he'd like to return to Gorky for a few months to be able to work alone on scientific work," Moscow News said.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Sakharov, who did not mention the name of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, described as "anti-democratic" some measures taken to quell nationalist unrest, particularly the toxic gas believed to have been used against demonstrators in Soviet Georgia earlier in 1989. A friend of the family, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he heard estimates that 70,000 mourners viewed the body before it was returned to Sakharov's apartment at midnight .</a>
