<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There was plenty of blame to go around at the end of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, but no one was willing to accept it.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52 child molestation charges.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>``The system is not going to protect children,'' said Jackie McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but didn't testify in the case.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Reiner, calling his dismissal of charges for lack of evidence ``the decision we're proud of,'' said the trial took so long because of the state's ponderous criminal justice system, delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind by Philibosian.</a>
