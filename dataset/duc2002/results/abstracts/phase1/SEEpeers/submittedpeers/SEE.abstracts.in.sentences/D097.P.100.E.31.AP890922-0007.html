<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This of course is at the same time that we're sheltering 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and the other Caribbean islands.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>At midnight, the center of Hugo was near latitude 32.7 degrees north and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m.</a>
