<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Former President Reagan thanked British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for backing him up when other allies backed down, heaping praise on his political soulmate as she heads off into the sunset.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>``Margaret Thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partner of the greatest personal integrity,'' Reagan said in a statement after Mrs. Thatcher announced her impending retirement.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Reagan, who spent Thanksgiving with friends at his Bel-Air home, called her resignation in the face of strong opposition a ``selfless and courageous decision in what she believes is the best interests of her country''.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>``She stood up to the Soviets and let them know she meant business,'' he said.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Like Reagan, however, Mrs. Thatcher was accused by liberals of widening the gap between the rich and poor in her country, and both clashed with organized labor.</a>
