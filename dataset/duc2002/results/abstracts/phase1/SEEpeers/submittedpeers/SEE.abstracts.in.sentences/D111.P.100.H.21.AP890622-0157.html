<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said Thursday.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>He said he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship, which sank after a battle May 27, 1941.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire.</a>
