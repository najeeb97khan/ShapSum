<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>THE STORY OF SECCHIA</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>At his confirmation hearing earlier in May 1989, Secchia pledged to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he had been in his different role as a political organizer and enthusiast.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>"Italian friends of mine telephoned me from Rome, aghast at the prospect of having Mr. Secchia represent the United States in their country," the chairman said.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>"I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the United States," Pell said.</a>
