<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared on his return from Moscow on Sunday that "the way is now free" for German reunification.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The chancellor said that almost all of the political parties and opposition groups in East Germany now support reunification.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>West Germany's Social Democratic Party is expected to campaign heavily in East Germany in support of a fledging branch of the party that has taken a surprisingly strong lead in public opinion polls.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But if the two Germanys are fused before the West Germany election in December, the growing number of Social Democratic voters in what today is East Germany -- who would presumably be allowed to vote in December -- could easily tip the balance away from the Christian Democrats, pushing Kohl out of the government leadership.</a>
