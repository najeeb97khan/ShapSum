<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We had to grab whatever we could."; Scientists warned of more, possibly larger eruptions from the 4,795-foot volcano, which was dormant for six centuries until it began spewing steam in April.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>"This could be only the beginning," said Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Angeles, a city of 300,000, is adjacent to Clark Air Base, but authorities had not ordered a general evacuation there.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The second explosion sent a plume of ash and steam 80,000 feet into the sky.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Shortly after midnight, a sixth explosion was reported.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Seismologists said the volcano had plenty of built-up magma and even more severe eruptions could come later.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>"The crisis has not ended yet," said Punongbayan, of the Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>On June 3, the volcano spewed ash in a mild eruption.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>That same day, 4,452-foot Mount Unzen in Japan erupted with an explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks that killed 38 people.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Experts say there is apparently no connection between Unzen and Pinatubo.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>There are about 21 active and 200 dormant volcanoes in the Philippines.</a>
