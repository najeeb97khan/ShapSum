<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors botched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Charles Buckey, father of Raymond and husband of Mrs. Buckey, suggested Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the case for its entire six years, was motivated by personal ambition.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a private child therapy group, Children's Institute International, to conduct the original interviews with the children.</a>
