<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight.</a>
