<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Hubble Space Telescope orbited with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame communications problems and lifted its lens cover, but its electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The shuttle trailed 50 miles behind Hubble when the aperture door opened 380 miles above Earth, but passed 3.7 miles beneath the telescope later in the day.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ground controllers sent a signal commanding the door to lift even though the telescope was in an automatic ``safe mode,'' with all motion stopped because of problems in linking its high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.</a>
