<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The lens cover on the Hubble Space Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>``You've been released from Hubble support; it's on its own,'' Mission Control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door opened.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>``Thank you, sir, that's great news,'' said Discovery Commander Loren J. Shriver.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The telescope still was having problems, however.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The team at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which guides the telescope, said the door-opening motion jarred the telescope more than had been expected and that the system reacted properly in shutting down.</a>
