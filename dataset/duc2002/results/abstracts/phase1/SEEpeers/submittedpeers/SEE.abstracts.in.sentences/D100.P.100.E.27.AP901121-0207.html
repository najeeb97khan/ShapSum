<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life: He was to play on John Lennon's new album.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years, busy taking care of his son, Sean, and admittedly out of songwriting ideas.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But in 1980, he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to the studio to make an album with his wife, Yoko Ono.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Producer Jack Douglas, who had worked with Lennon as an engineer, recruited Newmark, bassist Tony Levin, guitarist Hugh McCracken and other New York-based sessions players.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Newmark spent just one month in the studio, playing on the songs that eventually ended up on ``Double Fantasy'' and ``Milk and Honey,'' Lennon's final albums.</a>
