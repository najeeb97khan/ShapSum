<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Oscar statuette, one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Academy President Karl Malden said the ruling ``comes as a shock to me''.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The academy said it would appeal.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>``We are surprised that the court would base its decision on events which occurred half a century ago, overlooking the meticulous fashion in which the Academy has protected the integrity of its institutional symbol for decades,'' Malden said in a statement.</a>
