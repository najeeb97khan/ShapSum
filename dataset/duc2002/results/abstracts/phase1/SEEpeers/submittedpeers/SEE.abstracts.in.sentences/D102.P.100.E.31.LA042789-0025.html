<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Lucille Ball, the leggy showgirl, model and B-grade movie queen whose pumpkin hair and genius for comedy made her an icon of television, died early Wednesday, a week after undergoing emergency heart surgery.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Even a charge that Miss Ball was a Communist, made by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952, failed to dent her popularity.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Week after week, Lucy would find herself trapped in a vat of laundry starch, locked in a meat freezer, or lost on a subway with a loving cup stuck on her head.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>At various times a dress model and a hat model, Miss Ball, with long legs peeking out the bottom of a oversized cigarette pack, ultimately became a "Chesterfield girl".</a>
