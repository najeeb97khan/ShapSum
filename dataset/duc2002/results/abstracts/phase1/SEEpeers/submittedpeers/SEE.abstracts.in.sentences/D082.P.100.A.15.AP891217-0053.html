<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief Sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flower-draped body of Andrei D. Sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described as his country's conscience.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Based on official sources, an estimated 45,000 people filed through, and the flow of mourners continued into the night.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Forgive us"! one elderly woman cried out as she saw Sakharov's body in an open coffin, sloping to the floor of the beige marble Youth Palace in central Moscow.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>So many people wanted to see Sakharov's body lying in state that authorities extended the viewing period by four hours and moved the coffin so two rows of mourners could file past.</a>
