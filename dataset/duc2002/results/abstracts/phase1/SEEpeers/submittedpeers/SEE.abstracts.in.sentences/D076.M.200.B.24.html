<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has weakened her position and kicked off the race to succeed her by saying she plans to step down after winning another term, opposition leaders and political observers said.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A pro- Thatcher newspaper today said she had merely stated the obvious and that her statements were no ``cause for astonishment''.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thatcher set the example of what a woman could achieve in British society, but her critics say she did little else to help women along.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her 7 -year-old daughter wondered what title Thatcher's successor would hold, since ``he couldn't be called prime minister, that's a girl's name''.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For almost a decade, Thatcher was regarded at the White House as America's best friend, the trusted ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of administration policies.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>``Thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partner of the greatest personal integrity,'' President Reagan said in a statement after Mrs. Thatcher announced her impending retirement.</a>
