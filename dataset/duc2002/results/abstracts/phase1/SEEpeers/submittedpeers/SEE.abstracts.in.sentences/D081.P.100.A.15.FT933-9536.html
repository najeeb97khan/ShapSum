<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It has instead begun legal action to have the strike, which today entered its second week, declared illegal.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The miners' position seems untenable.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Romanians appear solidly opposed to the strike, angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of the equivalent of Dollars 290 a month.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.</a>
