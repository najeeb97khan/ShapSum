<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio rose to 20 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where search dogs indicated they'd detected human scents, said National Guard Capt. Jim Boling.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The number missing dropped to 16 with the other two bodies and the removal of two other names: a woman who called to say she was safe and a person who authorities weren't sure lived in the area, said coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.</a>
