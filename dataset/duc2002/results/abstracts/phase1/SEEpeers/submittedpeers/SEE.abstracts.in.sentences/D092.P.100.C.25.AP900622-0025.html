<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>"Iran is in a very active seismic region," Needham said, and that there have been many smaller quakes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Like on June 20, 1990's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people.</a>
