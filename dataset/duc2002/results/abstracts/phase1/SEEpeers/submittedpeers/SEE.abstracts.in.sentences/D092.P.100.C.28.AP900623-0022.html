<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Iran is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the country's Islamic leadership say.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denounced Iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the White House.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Iran has told the United Nations that the death toll is at least 36,000, but Gobadi said his organization has received estimates closer to 100,000.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.</a>
