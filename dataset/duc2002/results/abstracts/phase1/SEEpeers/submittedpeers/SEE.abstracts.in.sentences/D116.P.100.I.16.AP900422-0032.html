<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As Discovery's astronauts arrived from Johnson Space Center in Houston early Sunday afternoon, the shuttle Columbia was being transported to a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by Hubble and thus provide additional targets for the telescope.</a>
