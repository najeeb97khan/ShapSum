<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Meanwhile, Havana Radio reported today that 25,000 people were evacuated from Guantanamo Province on Cuba's southeastern coast as strong winds fanning out from Gilbert began brushing the island.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,'' the service said, adding, ``Little change in strength is expected for the next several hours as the hurricane moves westward over Jamaica''.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Forecasters said the hurricane had been gaining strength as it passed over the ocean after it dumped 5 to 10 inches of rain on the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share the island of Hispaniola.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused flooding in the Dominican Republic on Sunday night as the hurricane's center passed just south of the Barahona peninsula, then less than 100 miles from neighboring Haiti.</a>
