<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Incense burned and Buddhist monks in saffron-colored robes chanted prayers of mourning Friday as the immigrant families of children slain in this week's schoolyard massacre were joined by scores of other members of Stockton's Asian community in vigils of grief. City officials readied the city's Civic Auditorium for a Monday memorial ceremony for the families and friends of a Vietnamese student and four Cambodian pupils gunned down in the playground at Cleveland Elementary School Tuesday by armed drifter Patrick Edward Purdy, who killed himself with a single pistol shot to the head . Neighbors provided the five robed monks with incense, rice and money during their vigil .</a>
