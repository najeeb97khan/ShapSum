<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Honecker was still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in January, 1990, and was not well enough to be incarcerated.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany for 19 years until he was ousted in October, 1989, as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept the country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist government and the opening of the Berlin Wall.</a>
