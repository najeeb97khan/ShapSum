<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Sept. 15, 1989 _ Winds reach 150 mph.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Storm, designated a Category 4 hurricane, is considered ``extremely dangerous''.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Guadeloupe is devasted by winds measuring up to 150 mph. Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mph winds this past week, killing at least 41 people.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The ``greenhouse effect'' may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger than Hugo and last year's, 1988, record-setting Gilbert, some meteorologists say.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever for the insurance industry. State Farm Insurance Co. expects claims as high as $400 million in South Carolina, where it insures one out of every five homes, spokesman Jerry Parsons said.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.</a>
