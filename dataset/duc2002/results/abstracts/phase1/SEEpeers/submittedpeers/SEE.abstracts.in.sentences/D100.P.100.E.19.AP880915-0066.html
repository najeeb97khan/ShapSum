<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug - addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is ` ` totally fiction, '' Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter Goldman 's ` ` The Lives of John Lennon, '' which presents the ex - Beatle as a violent, drug - addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ono refuted virtually all of these charges, and countered through taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that Goldman 's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes.</a>
