<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Two weeks after a failed launch attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>>From its perch far above Earth's obstructing atmosphere, the telescope will be able to discern objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discovery's power system until its energy-collecting solar panels are deployed 380 miles above Earth, the highest a shuttle has ever gone.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of the telescope, $500 million has been spent to stockpile spare parts, train astronauts and develop computer software to operate the instrument.</a>
