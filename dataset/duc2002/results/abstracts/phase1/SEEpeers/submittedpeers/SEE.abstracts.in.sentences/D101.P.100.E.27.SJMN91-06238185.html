<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Some warnings came from Gorbachev's liberal advisers, such as Alexander Yakovlev, shortly before the coup.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But, incredibly, the clearest signals came from the hard-liners themselves.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A leading conservative journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known as the "nightingale of the General Staff," published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Why didn't the coup leaders incapacitate Gorbachev's guards, or at least separate them from him?</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If Gorbachev's contact with the outside world was limited to intercepting Western radio outlets on an ancient shortwave radio, how was he able to describe the news conference given by the collaborators, down to his view of their trembling hands?</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is highly unlikely that the hard-liners had been set up or ordered by Gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in order to improve his political standing.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Such a scenario would require an unprecedented degree of selfless commitment to Gorbachev on their part.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A more plausible scenario is that Gorbachev was initially a full member of the conspiracy, which, with his participation, could have clung to the fig leaf of constitutionality and would have thwarted the new Union Treaty, to have been signed last Tuesday, which provided for transfer of key levers of power from the federal presidency to the leaders of republics.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It is possible that, unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the start of the coup, Gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer residence.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Gorbachev did reveal, however, that two important officials had visited him in Crimea at the outset of the coup.</a>
