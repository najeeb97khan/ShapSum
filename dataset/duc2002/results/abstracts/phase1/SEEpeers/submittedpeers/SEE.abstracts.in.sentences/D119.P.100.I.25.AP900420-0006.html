<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>President Bush is expected to name a female career diplomat as U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua as that country prepares for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro, according to informed sources.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The sources said Thursday it is virtually certain the appointment will go to Melissa Wells, 57, currently ambassador to Mozambique.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>They said the administration believed a female ambassador could relate better than a man to Mrs. Chamorro, who takes office on Apr. 17, 1990.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Wells, the administration passed over several male career diplomats with long experience in that region, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.</a>
