<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist, composer, conductor and teacher and was, as well, the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Bernstein, known and beloved by the world as "Lenny," died at 6:15 p.m. in the presence of his son, Alexander, and physician, Kevin M. Cahill, who said the cause of death was complications of progressive lung failure.</a>
