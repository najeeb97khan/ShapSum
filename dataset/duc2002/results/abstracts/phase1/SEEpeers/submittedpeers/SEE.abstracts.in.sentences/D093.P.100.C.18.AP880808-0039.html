<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Overcrowding and safety violations caused an aging ferry to capsize in the Ganges River, killing as many as 400 people, a government report said.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A senior government official, discussing the confidential report on condition of anonymity, said authorities believed at least 300 people on the lower deck died when the ferry overturned Saturday morning.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Navy divers attempted to reach the submerged boat today, but the river was too muddy and its current too swift, said H.S. Pathak, head of the eight-member diving team.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>``We are trying our best, but because of the current, we are not able to go near the launch,'' Pathak said.</a>
