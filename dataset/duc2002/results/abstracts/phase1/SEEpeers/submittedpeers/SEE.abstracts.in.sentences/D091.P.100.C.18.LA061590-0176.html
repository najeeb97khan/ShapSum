<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A flash flood sent a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high rampaging through hill communities along the Ohio River, killing at least 10 people and leaving dozens missing, authorities said today. Two creeks just outside this Ohio River village of 4,300 residents overflowed when thunderstorms dumped about 4 inches of rain Thursday night in about an hour . Shadyside -- about 10 miles south of Wheeling, W.Va. -- is in Belmont County, a mostly hilly, rural area in eastern Ohio . About 200 residents were evacuated from their homes in central Ohio after 3 inches of rain fell in an hour, flooding streets and washing out rural roads .</a>
