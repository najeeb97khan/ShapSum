<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Mr. Ruoff at Fred S. James believes that even if losses from Hugo total as much as $5 billion, insurers won't feel enough "financial pain, such as not being able to pay shareholder dividends," to compel them to boost premium rates right away.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>An official at Nationwide Insurance noted that the company has $1 of surplus for every $2 of insurance that it writes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Insurers also buy protection for themselves through reinsurance by paying another company a portion of the premium to bear some of the losses.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Michael Lewis at Dean Witter Reynolds said losses from Hugo could be big enough to "temporarily" increase reinsurance rates.</a>
