<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against Buckey, one of the original seven defendants in the McMartin Pre-School case.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In that 1986 interview, Peggy Buckey was "quite eloquent" in arguing that charges against her brother, Ray, and mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, should be dropped as well, Mann recalled Friday.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>And Thursday's not-guilty verdicts in Ray and Peggy McMartin Buckey's trial gave Mann the happy ending he was hoping for -- happy, at least, from his point of view.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Unlike the hottest true-life property of the moment -- the Stuart murder case in Boston, which has CBS and The Fries Co. racing to produce the first docudrama -- McMartin creates some tricky legal and moral problems.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Stevens, who said he had asked to be removed from the McMartin trial team in October, 1985, said he and Mann agreed in March, 1986, to produce a book and movie about the case with the understanding that their discussions would become public after the trial and appeals were over.</a>
