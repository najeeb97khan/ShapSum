<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>British Prime Minister John Major said today that Iraqi troops will have to be "forcibly removed" from Kuwait if President Saddam Hussein does not agree to withdraw them peacefully.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>On the gulf issue at least, Major's remarks augured well for his talks with President Bush late in the day at Camp David, the Maryland presidential retreat where the two leaders were planning an overnight stay.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Major, who arrived here Thursday night for a 40-hour visit, wasted no time in going on a rhetorical offensive against Hussein, using a succession of four television interviews aired shortly after dawn.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>At the same time, Major demonstrated the kinder, gentler face he has brought to British politics since his accession, showing none of the abrasiveness that was a Thatcher hallmark.</a>
