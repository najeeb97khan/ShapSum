<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some experts said the results are good news, because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals, where angioplasty is not available.</a>
