<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>British Prime Minister John Major said today that Iraqi troops will have to be "forcibly removed" from Kuwait if President Saddam Hussein does not agree to withdraw them peacefully. Major, just as unyielding in talking about Hussein as was his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, rejected the notion that a partial Iraqi pullback from Kuwait would help bring about a solution to the crisis . "A complete withdrawal is necessary, a partial withdrawal won't do," Major said in a display of solidarity with U.S. policy on the Persian Gulf .</a>
