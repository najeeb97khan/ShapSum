<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Anyone who was alive in 1963 remembers where he was when President Kennedy was assassinated. And anyone who was at Candlestick Park on Oct. 16, 1989 night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget . To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, mainly because I was awake this time . My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I knew what was happening .</a>
