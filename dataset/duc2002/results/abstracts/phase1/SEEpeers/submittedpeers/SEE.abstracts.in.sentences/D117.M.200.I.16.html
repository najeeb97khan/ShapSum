<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Prize (courtesy of Booker plc, the food and agri-business group) is no longer the richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige, and sales, for the winner, and, say its admirers, helpfully brings The Novel to public attention.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was almost universally well-reviewed.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria - English language and non-American - for consideration for the award.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was Steady, a first n! ov! el by Claire Messud, which was on the 'long list' before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge.</a>
