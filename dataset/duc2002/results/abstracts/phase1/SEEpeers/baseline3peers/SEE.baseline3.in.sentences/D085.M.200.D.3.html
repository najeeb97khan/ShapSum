<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Amid the uproar of live coverage by the major networks and scores of other media organizations, National Hurricane Center forecasters went about their business of monitoring Hurricane Hugo.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Supercomputers, satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow, giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Here is a chronology of Hurricane Hugo's destructive path across the Caribbean into South Carolina:</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This historic city has survived the ravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied 300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in Hurricane Hugo.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The ``greenhouse effect'' may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger than Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, some meteorologists say.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.</a>
