<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>``The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at 330 nautical miles above the Earth,'' Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work,'' Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later.</a>
