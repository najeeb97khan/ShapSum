<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of Sciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates for the new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel Peace Prize winner.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human rights activist, who won the Nobel in 1975, said in a speech to the academy that many scientists objected to the slate for Sunday's election approved by the leadership in January.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Sakharov and several other well-known proponents of reform are missing from the list.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The official news agency Tass quoted him as saying, however, that scientists were upset ``not because Sakharov was not nominated, but because the role of scientific institutions was ignored''.</a>
