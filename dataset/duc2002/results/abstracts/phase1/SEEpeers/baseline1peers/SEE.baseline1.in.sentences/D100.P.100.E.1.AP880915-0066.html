<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>``It's amazing that somebody took such a poetic license.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>I don't see John in there ...</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It's a very dramatically described something, but it's not about John,'' Ono said Wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman.</a>
