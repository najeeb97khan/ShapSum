In a strongly worded attack, Benazir Bhutto charged Wednesday that powerful army generals had forced her ouster as prime minister, and she warned that the army will "take over" within a few weeks, ending Pakistan's brief experiment with democracy .
 "The military is running the show," Bhutto told reporters here two days after President Ghulam Ishaq Khan abruptly dismissed her 20-month-old government, dissolved the National Assembly and declared a state of emergency .
 "The caretaker government is temporary," Bhutto said at a news conference.
 "Within a few weeks, the army will take over" .
 Military and government officials denied the charges and insisted that general elections will be held Oct. 24 .
