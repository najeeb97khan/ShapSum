 [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, while addressing editors of national newspapers in Islamabad, said that the question of rolling back Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program does not arise, because the nation's defense depends on it.
 She said that the last four governments agreed fully on this issue, and that all were united on it.
 She also asked the United States to review its decision on the use of the Pressler Amendment against Pakistan, and the unfair treatment that was practiced over the last several years.
