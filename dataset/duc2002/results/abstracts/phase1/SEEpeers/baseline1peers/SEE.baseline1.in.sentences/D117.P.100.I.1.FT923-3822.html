<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>THE annual Booker ballyhoo got going again yesterday when the judges for this year's Pounds 20,000 prize for British (and Commonwealth) fiction announced the shortlist.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Prize (courtesy of Booker plc, the food and agri-business group) is no longer the richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige, and sales, for the winner, and, say its admirers, helpfully brings The Novel to public attention.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This year's shortlist contains no surprises.</a>
