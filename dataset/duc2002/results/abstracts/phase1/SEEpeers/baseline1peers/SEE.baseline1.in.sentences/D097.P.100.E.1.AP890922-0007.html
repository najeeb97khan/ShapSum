<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>``This is a disaster staring us right in the eye,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston, where the hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and caused utility transformers to explode.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>``All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have taken have been sufficient,'' Riley said as Hugo's eye bore in on the city.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>``I just hope and pray we can get through this without any loss of life''.</a>
