<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike, pressing the government for higher wages.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It has instead begun legal action to have the strike, which today entered its second week, declared illegal.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The miners' position seems untenable.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Romanians appear solidly opposed to the strike, angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of the equivalent of Dollars 290 a month.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Most workers earn less than Dollars 80.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.</a>
