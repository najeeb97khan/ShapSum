Benazir Bhutto, leader of the People's Democratic Party, on Thursday promised to end the ``reactionary'' legacy of the late President Zia ul-Haq if she is elected Nov. 16.
 ``Zia's 11-year rule was replete with floggings, hangings and suppression of democratic people and institutions,'' Ms. Bhutto told tens of thousands of cheering supporters, who punctuated her speech in this northeastern city with chants of ``Benazir will rule''! and ``Benazir, the rising sun''!
 The elections for the 217-seat national assembly ``will usher in an era of freedom and prosperity for the people of Pakistan,'' Ms. Bhutto told the crowd.
 ``That will be the end of the Zia legacy''.
