Police Wednesday arrested the husband of ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who denounced the move as a "pure witch hunt" to intimidate her during the current election campaign .
 Businessman Asif Ali Zardari was arrested in Karachi for alleged involvement in an extortion case and two cases of illegal bank loans, state television said .
 Zardari has been a major target of investigations since Bhutto's dismissal by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in August for allegedly heading an administration riddled with corruption, nepotism and abuse of power .
 He was charged in the kidnaping last April of businessman Murtaza Hussain Bukhari, a Pakistani-born British citizen, and the extortion of $800,000 from him .
