Tens of thousands of people today marked the first anniversary of the death of President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq by holding an anti-government rally denouncing his successor, Benazir Bhutto.
 The Zia loyalists either walked or jammed teetering buses to converge on the capital's huge Faisal Mosque for a prayer sevice.
 ``Death to Benazir Bhutto''! and ``Benazir is a traitor and an agent of the Russians and Indians''! the crowd shouted.
 It was the largest rally by oppenents of Ms. Bhutto's 8-month-old government.
 Unofficial estimates put the crowd total at 50,000.
 ``What we had before was a military dictatorship.
 Now we have a civilian dictatorship,'' said one bystander.
