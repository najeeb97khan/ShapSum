<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The lens cover on the Hubble Space Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>``You've been released from Hubble support; it's on its own,'' Mission Control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door opened.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>``Thank you, sir, that's great news,'' said Discovery Commander Loren J. Shriver.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>``There are handshakes and smiles all around up here,'' said Steve Hawley, who had been at the controls when the telescope was released into its own orbit on Wednesday.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>``I'll bet it's just that way down there, too''.</a>
