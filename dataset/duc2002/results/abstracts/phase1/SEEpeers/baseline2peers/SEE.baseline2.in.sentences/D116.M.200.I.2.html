<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Hubble Space Telescope was awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>``We are out of the `safe-mode' right now,'' said Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>He said the telescope was running on a ``normal control-all mode,'' where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected eventually to look back 14 billion light years _ nearly to the birth of the universe.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope,'' said Bolden.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>``It makes little kids' eyes light up.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science''.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been in a ``safe mode'' with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.</a>
