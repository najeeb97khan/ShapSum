<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>``It's a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time,'' Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>``It doesn't happen very often.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>How it develops, we don't know''.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>``We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>About one of six develop,'' said Clark.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>By Sept. 8, the system became a depression.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It reached tropical storm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a named tropical storm.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74 mph.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems didn't ``is a mystery more or less,'' said University of Miami meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>``The first part of the summer we were biting our nails, wondering why these (other) disturbances didn't develop,'' he said Thursday.</a>
