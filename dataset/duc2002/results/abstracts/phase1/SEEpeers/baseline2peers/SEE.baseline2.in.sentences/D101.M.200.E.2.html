<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>IT IS the stuff of a Byzantine Cold War novel, enticing enough to grab the attention of even the most benign conspiracy theorist: Did Mikhail Gorbachev orchestrate the coup that almost overthrew him?</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The blueprint for imposing a state of emergency was drawn by Gorbachev himself last winter.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>He pushed through the legislation that included suspension of political activity and of freedom of the press.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>He hand-picked the heads of the coercive institutions and other key officials who took part in the coup .</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Gorbachev chose to ignore warnings about the right's impending attempt to seize power.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some warnings came from Gorbachev's liberal advisers, such as Alexander Yakovlev, shortly before the coup.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>But, incredibly, the clearest signals came from the hard-liners themselves.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A leading conservative journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known as the "nightingale of the General Staff," published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>With remarkable candor, Baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Needless to say, Baklanov delivered on that warning and joined the Gang of Eight.</a>
