<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Hurricane Gilbert weakened to a tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees along the Texas-Mexico border.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>At least 109 people have been killed and more than 800,000 left homeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean with 175 mph wind earlier this week, then crossed the Yucatan Peninsula and Gulf of Mexico before slamming into northeastern Mexico.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>One person died today in Texas after being injured in a tornado.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But by this morning, the once massive storm's maximum sustained winds had flagged to 65 mph, nine less than hurricane strength, and forecasters said the eye had all but disappeared.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, they warned of continued danger from flash flooding inland.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. EDT as it proceeded 50 miles southeast of the city of Monterrey in northern Mexico, said Noel Rishnychok, a meteorologist with the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Winds were still weakening as the storm moved west-northwest at 12 mph, he said.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Gulf Coast residents expressed relief that the storm, which earlier was deemed the most powerful ever tracked in the Western Hemisphere, pulled its punch as it came ashore despite delivering a spate of tornadoes.</a>
