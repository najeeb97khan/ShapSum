<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>NEW YORK -- An experiment with more than 1,700 high blood pressure patients showed that a blood and urine test can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The experiment suggests that doctors could test their patients with mild to moderate high blood pressure to determine how intensively they should be treated to prevent heart attacks, researchers said.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The experiment indicated that the test can spot those patients with extremely low risk of heart attack as well as those with a high risk .</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test, which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin, might suggest a new "risk factor" for heart attacks.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>About half of the 1.5 million Americans who suffer a heart attack each year don't have the known risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, obesity and high blood pressure.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is unknown what distinguishes these seemingly healthy people from those who don't suffer heart attacks.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The blood and urine test is already being done in many commercial laboratories but for medical conditions other than heart attack risk, said John H. Laragh of the Cardiovascular Center at Cornell University and New York Hospital.</a>
