<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Laughter and tears flowed freely as the Broadway theatrical community said goodby Thursday to Leonard Bernstein at the Majestic Theater.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Longtime friends and colleagues -- those who knew him as Lenny -- paid tribute to the musical-theater dynamo with heartfelt and humorous words, and often in song .</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The capacity audience -- invited friends, relatives and theatrical personalities as well as 850 members of the public who started lining up at 7 a.m. -- heard recollections of an energetic Bernstein who danced until dawn in discos as well as a poignant account of his final days .</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book for "West Side Story," hosted the 75-minute tribute to Bernstein, 72, who died Oct. 14.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>"Wherever Lenny was, was theater; his every move was a stage direction," he said, as many in the audience laughed knowingly .</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Another "West Side Story" collaborator, director-choreographer Jerome Robbins, had earned a laugh before he even spoke, thanks to Laurents' introductory words: "Fearless as Lenny was, there were two figures he did fear -- God and Jerome Robbins" .</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>After noting that he wished he were young enough to pay homage to Bernstein by performing the sailor's variation he created in the ballet "Fancy Free," Robbins, 72, recalled that halcyon 1944 collaboration between the two 25-year-olds.</a>
