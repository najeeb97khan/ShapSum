<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Ferries are among the safest vessels afloat.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But, as the tragic sinking of the Estonia with the loss of more than 800 lives demonstrates, when they do go down the toll in human life can be high.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As ferries increase in size, so the numbers on board at risk from mechanical failure or a crew error go up.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The move to roll-on roll-off ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The United Nations International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and its members, the ship-owning nations, have devoted much thought over the past two decades to ship safety.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>But the sinking of the Estonia should lead to a new review of ferry safety.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Particularly worrying are the eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrated the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Unlike the Herald, the Estonia appears to have had its doors closed, but ro-ros are undoubtedly very vulnerable to water penetration.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues.</a>
