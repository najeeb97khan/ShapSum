<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After hours of heated delib-eration - under a system described as 'mad' by one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker judges, acknowledged that Mr Kelman's book in particular might be deemed inaccessible.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>'We had an extremely difficult final meeting and were very divided,' he said after three hours of debate.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Rabbi Julia Neuberger, the only woman on the judging panel, said she was made extremely cross by the decision.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>'It's just a drunken Scotsman railing against bureaucracy,' she said.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>'My eyes are stretched in disbelief.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The voting system is completely mad.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Kelman was the least favourite of the three front runners.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If it had been a short story it would have been fine'.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Mr Kelman's book is, according to some observers, the most difficult work to have won the prize.</a>
