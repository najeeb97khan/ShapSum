<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>I entirely concur with their choice.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner.</a>
