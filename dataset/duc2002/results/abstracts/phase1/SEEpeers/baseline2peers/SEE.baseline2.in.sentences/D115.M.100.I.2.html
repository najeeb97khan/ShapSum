<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>An earthquake that devastated parts of Nepal and India earlier this week has killed more than 980 people, officials from the two countries said Friday.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Mourners paraded through the streets of this medieval town, calling for revenge after a former legislator was beaten to death by political rivals while he was distributing relief supplies to earthquake victims.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>``Hang the murderers,'' scores of young men chanted as they marched in front of a jeep bearing the battered body of Karna Hyanju, once a sympathizer of the now-outlawed Communist Party.</a>
