<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Here is a state-by-state summary of the latest drought developments:</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Recent rain in central and south Alabama haven't helped cities' water supplies enough to lift surcharges and limits on outdoor watering.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Northern Alabama has missed most of the rain and the region's top crop, cotton, is in a critical situation, said John Trotman, state director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service .</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Georgia's carpet industry may be forced to reduce production and lay off workers if the drought continues for an extended period, industry officials said.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>``It is something you don't like to think about, but if you don't have water, you can't run your mills,'' said John A. Shaheen, vice chairman of World Carpets Inc. in Dalton .</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The drought has inflicted serious damage to wildlife along the Illinois River, even though the water level has remained near normal.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Wayne Herndon, a biologist with the state Department of Conservation, said the drought, now nearly midway through its second summer, has damaged the river's backwater lakes, virtually eliminating a year's supply of the river's gamefish.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The mercury hit 100 degrees Friday at O'Hare International Airport, bettering the previous high for the day of 99 and establishing a second record by giving the city its fifth 100-degree or better temperature of the summer.</a>
