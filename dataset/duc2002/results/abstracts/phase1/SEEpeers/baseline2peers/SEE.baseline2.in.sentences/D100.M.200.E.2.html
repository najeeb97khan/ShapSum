<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>NIXON, disco, LSD -- it's no surprise, really, that those '70s rejects have staged comebacks.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But Yoko Ono?</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The flaky avant-garde artist whose idea of music was to scream inside a plastic bag while John Lennon played guitar?</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The Evil One who single-handedly killed the Beatles and destroyed her husband's talent and ambition?</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Who could possibly regard her as anything other than a crackpot and a public menace?</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Well, let's see: there's party rockers the B52s and cult singer Lene Lovich -- successful, critically acclaimed musicians who credit Ono's music as an influence.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>There's the Whitney Museum of Art, which exhibited Ono's artwork last year -- one of the 10 museum shows she has had around the world.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>There's also the American Film Institute, which Ono says is staging an international tour of her experimental films.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>And Ono's record label -- "they want to put out all my songs in a kind of CD box or something," Ono says.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Surprised? So's Ono.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>She's used to rougher treatment.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Acceptance is a difficult concept for her.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>"I'm used to sort of knocking the door rather than having the door opened and having to cope with entering it," Ono says during a telephone interview.</a>
