<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Rev. John D. Eales of St. Cross Episcopal Church -- where McMartin pupils claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals -- told the congregation during his sermon that, "after much prayer and consultation," he realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims .</a>
