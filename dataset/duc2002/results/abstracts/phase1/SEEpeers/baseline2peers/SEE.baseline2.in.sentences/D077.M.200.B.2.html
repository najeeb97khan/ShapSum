<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Although they are a continent apart, the cities of Charleston, S.C., and San Francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>They are the scenes of two of the century's costliest, back-to-back natural disasters: Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake .</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>There are dramatic similarities and profound differences in the ways these two cities were affected and altered in the first week after they were ravaged by two powerful forces of nature -- one that angrily swept across the land from the sea and one that violently rumbled beneath the earth .</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>"From the standpoint of compassion, of all the people in America we can feel the hurt that the San Francisco area is going through the most," Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said Sunday, one month after Hugo hit.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>"We know it means, at best, the disruption of normal life for some time and, at worst, the loss of life" .</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Charleston had warning.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>San Francisco did not.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes can be tracked by planes and radar, their paths predicted with sufficient certainty for those in harm's way to secure property and to flee.</a>
