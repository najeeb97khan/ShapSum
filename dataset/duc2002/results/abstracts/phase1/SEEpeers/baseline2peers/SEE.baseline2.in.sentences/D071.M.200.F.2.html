<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>ON A recent day, the telephone rang in the home of William Wegman.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The photographer, known for his hilarious portraits of his Weimaraners, picked up. "Hello" .</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Woof.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this house, man and dogs speak as one.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Their relationship is unusually tender.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>One need only listen while Wegman murmurs to Fay Ray and Battina, her 1 1/2-year-old daughter.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>On Valentine's Day, for example, he said, "I'll take them out and play with them longer."; "But I don't want to be known as a dog zombie," said Wegman, who did go to the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show without the dogs.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>"I go to movies and have friends and play sports.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>I swim, play tennis and wind surf."; Battina begs to differ.</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>During a recent visit, it was possible to see how the artist gets two even-tempered, relaxed, normal dogs to slip into florid housedresses or scratch each other's backs.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The three simply adore each other.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>"I'd never heard of Weimaraners," said the artist, who was born 47 years ago in Longmeadow, Mass.</a>
