<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>I entirely concur with their choice.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>He has a deadly innocence.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>No wonder the Majors liked this film.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If he did not see the similarity, that is still more revealing.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few days ago, Major disclosed an unknown fact: his father was once a farmer.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy with agriculture'.</a>
