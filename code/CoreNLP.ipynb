    "### Idea behind Coreference Resolution\n",
    "We can compare each string with the every other string in the text and if there exists a coreference between those two strings we can cosntruct an edge between the two strings (or decrease the weight of the edge by some lambda). If two sentences have some coreference between them then they are closer to each other as can be depicted by the small weight between the nodes pertaining to those sentences.\n",
    "#### Challenges:\n",
    "1. Many of the sentences can have coreference between them thus many of the edges will get their weights minimized in general won't affect the behaviour of algorithm on the graph.\n",
    "2. Time complexity will increase further as the time taken to find coreference is O(n-squared) (considering parsing time to be constant)"
