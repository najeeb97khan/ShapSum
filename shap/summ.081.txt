The Iranian quake was the stronger measuring 7.7 (vs. 6.9) on the   Richter scale.
Both killed about 25,000 people most of whom died as their fragile   homes collapsed.
The earthquake that struck northern Iran Thursday resembled the Armenian earthquake   of Dec. 7, 1988.
The Iranian quake occurred just after midnight, so most people were   inside asleep when it hit.
Thursday's quake was the strongest ever recorded in that area where two major plates   of the earth's crust meet.
It occurred in an area where most of the adobe buildings are   on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts causing structures to collapse.
At least   25,000 died and thousands were injured as residents were buried in the rubble of their   homes.
The earthquake that hit Iran early Thursday exacted particularly large casualties   because people were asleep in fragile homes built on a flood plain of loosely deposited   soil that shifts in an earthquake.
The quake   measured between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter scale.
The estimated 50,000 deaths from the earthquake which hit Iran last Thursday would    make it the fourth deadliest earthquake worldwide in the last fifty years.
