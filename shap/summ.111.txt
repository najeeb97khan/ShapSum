this comes after allegations that on the 1970s, Tower would consume as   much as a bottle of scotch in one sitting.
The Senate Armed Services Committee, controlled by the Democrats, has voted 11-9 along party   lines to recommend that the full senate reject the nomination of former senator John Tower as   Secretary of Defense.
Senator Tower was listed in fair condition following the   surgery and is expected to make a full recovery.
Tower insisted that Senator Nunn used FBI inquiries   to discredit him and to strike at the president of the United States.
The vote came after a bitter and divisive debate which centered on Tower's   drinking habits, his inappropriate behavior toward women and business dealings with defense   contractors.
Staff members also reported that recently he has been ordering only   tonic water with his meals.
Tower was qualified for the   job, having himself served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
The first controversy surrounding a Bush cabinet nominee has erupted during the confirmation   hearings of former Senator John Tower as Secretary of Defense.
In testimony before the Senate   Armed Services Committee, Paul Weyrich told the committee that Tower may lack the moral   fiber for the position, citing inappropriate use of alcohol and questionable associations with   women.
