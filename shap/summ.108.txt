A faulty power unit    forced cancellation of an April 10th launch.
The shuttle Discovery is to lift off from Kennedy Space Center at 8:31am EDT Tuesday   with five astronauts and the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
NASA must launch Discovery by Saturday   or wait eight days to recharge Hubble's batteries.
The problem was incorrect pointing   of either Hubble or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite.
A replacement steering unit was successfully tested.
Two shuttles have not been on NASA's launch   pads simultaneously since the 1986 Challenger launch.
Batteries will power Hubble until wing-like solar panels extend, with manual help if   necessary.
After delays since 1983, technical problems postponed an   April 10th launch.
Later, shuttle Columbia will take up   astronomical observatory Astro to measure ultraviolet radiation and provide Hubble with   additional targets.
Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle   has ever gone, to place Hubble in orbit above Earth's distorting atmosphere.
Shuttle Discovery is to launch from Kennedy Space Center at 8:31am EDT today, climb   a record 380 miles, and place the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit.
