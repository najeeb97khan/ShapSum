John Onoda, a spokesman at McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters said the first of   the chain's outlets in a communist country will open on March 24th.
The success of the   American restaurant will depend on its acceptance by Yugoslavians who are long   accustomed to eating the hamburger like pljeskavica which is made of pork and onions,   served on bread and eaten with the hands, much like a hamburger.
The next scheduled   opening in a communist country will occur by the end of the year in Budapest, Hungary.
Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a   restaurant in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
McDonald's negotiations with the Soviet Union over many years have not been fruitful.
This, its first outlet in a communist country, has 350   seats, employs 110 people and is capable of serving 2,500 meals per hour.
The McDonald's   hamburgers, fries and shakes will compete with a local favorite fast-food dish, the   pljeskavica, ground pork and onions on a bun.
McDonald's will open its first outlets in Korea through a 50-50 joint venture, McAhn   Industries Ltd., founded with Harvard trained accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Mr. Ahn   Hyo Young.
