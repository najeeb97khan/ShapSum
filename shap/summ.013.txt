General Accident (GA), the leading British insurer, estimated yesterday that its losses  from Hurricane Andrew might reach $40 million; however, GA has only a half-percent  share of the Florida market and the estimate is based on the assumption that GA's catastrophe insurance would be triggered by the extensive claims.
The company's loss  adjustors guess that losses to all insurers might exceed $8 billion.
There was concern last night that the  hurricane might hit New Orleans which is especially vulnerable because of its low-lying  location.
Most of the  damage from the dollar crisis came a week ago Friday and the following Monday when  bond yields jumped sharply and the Dow Jones average dropped by more than 75  points.
At this time no one is certain of the extent of losses.
Other insurers have  estimated that losses from the storm that hit Florida and Louisiana might be anywhere  from $1 billion to $20 billion.
Last night U.S. cities along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on  storm watch for Hurricane Andrew which early yesterday caused at least eight deaths  and heavy property damage in southern Florida.
