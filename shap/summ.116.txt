Major won 185 votes.
Queen Elizabeth II will summon Major and ask him to form a cabinet after Thatcher   surrenders her seals of office at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday.
John Major, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Chancellor of the Exchequer and her   chosen heir apparent, was elected Conservative Party leader today and will become prime   minister.
Major, 47, a former welfare recipient, was elected to Parliament in1979, was appointed   foreign secretary in July 1989, and Chancellor of the Exchequer three months later.
Both his opponents, former Defense Secretary Heseltine   and Foreign Secretary Hurd, with131 votes and 56 votes, respectively, conceded defeat.
Though Major was two votes short of the required majority in yesterday's election, he   was elected leader of the ruling Conservative Party after his challengers, former Defense   Secretary Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Hurd, conceded defeat.
Propelled to power by   Margaret Thatcher who expected to continue her program discretely, Major is a weak   leader.
Mrs. Thatcher, ending 11 years in power, intended to submit her resignation to Queen   Elizabeth II on Wednesday.
Some anti-John Major Conservatives are happy about the defeat.
