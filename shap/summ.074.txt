The Los Angeles marathon has a marketing orientation rather than that of a first class   athletic event.
Mercedes-Benz, along with other sponsors, provides the race with the bulk   of its operating budget.
In only 5 years, it has become the best marketed, slickest, most modern   and sponsor-driven of the world's major marathons.
Organizers of the marathon expect to   increase this year's total purse of $202,520 by $100,000 next year.
The lineup of commercial support is   impressive.
It has been designed to make   money for the closely held company that controls it as well as for the city.
The Los Angeles marathon is a commercial spectacle.
The marketing approach makes the race lucrative, but it does not   give it prestige or attract the world's best runners.
More than   18,000 runners are expected this year and the event is expected to gross about 5 million   in cash and services to break even.
The winner of the women's   marathon had a time of 2 hours and 32 minutes, considerable slower than in Los Angeles   and Seoul.
DeAnna Sodoma of Escondido won he fir marathon wheelchair race in 2:17:52 and Saul   Hernandez of Mexico won the men's division in 1:57:50.
