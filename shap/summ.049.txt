Hugo, a category 4 hurricane, struck South Carolina Thursday and officials hoped   precautions were sufficient.
As Hugo approached, roads and resort towns from Hilton   Head to Myrtle Beach were nearly empty as coastal residents fled inland and crowded   into shelters.
Hurricane-force winds first hit land at 9:15pm.
119-mph   winds in Charleston brought down power lines, snapped trees, exploded utility   transformers, and littered the street with tin roofs.
Three hours later the 10-mile   eye of the storm passed just east of Charleston, with top winds of 135 mph.
Hugo was expected to turn north, cause severe flooding, and bring tornadoes.
Hurricane Hugo raged into Charleston Thursday night packing 135-mph winds.
Few   residents had experienced such a dangerous, killer hurricane, the first major storm to   strike the city since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles south in 1959.
The last big   storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in 1979.
Property damage escalated because Hugo scored a direct hit on   Charleston and then veered northwest.
At the National Hurricane Center, a tracking model   embodying knowledge of meteorological conditions and indicators of change constantly   reflected weather conditions and storm position.
