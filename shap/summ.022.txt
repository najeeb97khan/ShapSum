More than 2,500 dogs representing 138 breeds, will compete for prizes at Sunday's All   Breed Dog Show and Obedience Trials at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
In the scent relay, teams of dogs will jump over hurdles and locate the jackets of   their owners.
There will also be a demonstration of how dogs herd farm animals.
Between   judgings, a troupe of Dobermans will jump through hoops and barrels and will scale   walls.
William Wegman's two Weimaraners serve as both companions and artist models to the   artist.
The breed is affectionate and can hold a pose.
The mother-daughter dogs live with   Wegman in his home, a former Orthodox synagogue on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
There   will also be an expert to answer questions on behavioral questions about dogs, free   veterinary advice, and a computer for visitors to learn which breed would best suit their   life style.
The 47-year-old artist began his association with Weimaraners in 1970 when he acquired   a puppy, Man Ray, for $35 dollars.
The top show dog is a   fluffy little Pomeranian and the police dog is an amiable German Shepherd.
