On Saturday at 1 A.M. China time tens of thousands of troops entered Beijing and   marched toward Tiananmen Square, the symbol of China's political power.
Skirmishing   between the troops and the demonstrators continued throughout the day and evening.
The troops   were stopped short of their goal by thousands of student demonstrators.
The   troops used tear gas and the students threw rocks and bottles    At midnight armored vehicles broke through the barriers and 49 troop-carrying trucks   advanced on the square.
The confrontation between Chinese troops and hundreds of thousands of demonstrators   ended in the killing and wounding of untold numbers in Tiananmen Square.
At 5 A.M.   Sunday students began leaving the square that they had occupied for three weeks.
The bloody encounter was the climax of trouble that had been escalating since April.
As   early as 27 April more than 150,000 surged past police lines and filled Tiananmen   Square.
The   protesters, mainly students along with some workers and intellectuals, finally were forced   to leave Tiananmen early in the morning of 4 June.
The students defied the government's order to leave, and blocked streets leading to   the square.
