Storms roared across the middle Mississippi Valley and the Southeast on Wednesday,   bringing tornadoes, high winds, and baseball-sized hail.
Tornados pounded   Huntsville, Alabama.
Tornados also were identified or suspected in southern Illinois,   northern Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee.
Other storms, with   locally heavy rain, were scattered along the northern Atlantic Coast, which had been   experiencing unseasonably warm weather.
These storms were created as a   strong cold front moved eastward from Missouri and Arkansas.
Snow continued in the West and upper   Midwest.
Severe thunderstorms hit in Arkansas,   Ohio, and Kentucky.
Peru, Indiana reported the heaviest rainfall.
Rescue teams continue to sift through the rubble and don't expect a final   casualty count until morning.
Cars were picked up and power lines started   snapping and arcing.
The violent storm that spun tornados across the South and Midwest, moved into the   Northeast on Thursday, causing an elementary school cafeteria to cave in, killing seven   children.
Although an   elementary school was hit, most of the dead were in apartments, stores, or cars.
A tornado watch remains for northeast New York state and   much of Vermont and New Hampshire.
