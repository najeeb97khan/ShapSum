The 81-year-old Honecker and his wife Margot Honecker, had been living with   their daughter in Santiago, since his release from prison in 1993.
Honecker had been   suffering from liver cancer.
More than 200 people were shot to death or killed by land mines   as they tried to escape East Germany's Communist rule.
It is   not clear whether or not Margot Honecker will be allowed to remain in Chile.
Erich Honecker, the former head of East Germany, died on 29 May 1994 in Santiago   Chile.
East Germany's ousted secret police chief, Erich Mielke, threatened to break former   Communist leader Erich Honecker's neck when the two faced each other in jail.
Both Lutheran and Catholic churches have offered Honecker refuge.
East Germany has been   caught up in a virtual frenzy to root out corruption and abuse of office since Honecker's   ouster in October.
Honecker's lawyer, Nicolas Becker said that while he had   refused an operation, Honecker had done everything sensible in regard to treatment.
Mielke   remains in custody, Honecker was released for health reasons.
It was not   known if Honecker had left a will or where the funeral would be held.
