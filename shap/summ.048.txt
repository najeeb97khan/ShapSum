Supercomputers and satellites helped predict the path and landfall of Hurricane   Hugo in time to allow evacuation of Charleston, S.C., but hurricane tracking is   not an exact science.
The intensity of Hugo was upgraded on the basis of Air   Force reconnaissance just hours before it hit Charleston.
To predict the path, supercomputers   use satellite data to make constantly changing predictions.
There are no reliable   computer models for forecasting strength.
The best information for   predicting hurricanes still comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane.
Forecasters analyze   the predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current   path to make an educated guess about the landfall.
Today the hurricane moved inland with steadily diminishing winds and   was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 A.M. Two insurance companies said Tuesday that they anticipate $600 million in claims   from Hurricane Hugo which may become the most expensive ever for the industry.
Hugo stormed through the eastern Caribbean and the   Carolinas this past week with 135 mph winds, killing at least 41 people.
After devastating Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, the Virgin Islands and Puerto   Rico on Sunday and Monday with winds up to 150 mph, killing at least 20 people   and leaving perhaps 100,000 homeless, Hurricane Hugo slowed down yesterday to   winds of 105-125 mph, only to pick up speed again and crash into Charleston,   S.C. at midnight with winds of 135 mph.
