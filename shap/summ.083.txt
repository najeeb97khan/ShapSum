On Saturday at 1 a.m. tens of thousands of troops entered Beijing from the east   marching toward Tiananmen Square.
Blocked east of the square by thousands of   people, the troops dispersed, walking around near the square in small groups.
Later about 5,000 troops appeared firing tear gas and clubbing protesters west of the   square.
About   noon two truckloads of People's Armed Police attacked crowds east of the square.
Shooting continued through the night until 5 a.m. Sunday morning when the   demonstrators,  surrounded by armed and firing troops, began leaving the square,   ending their three-week occupation.
The pro-democracy banners and protesters' tents are now gone from Tiananmen   Square, replaced by tanks and drilling soldiers.
Skirmishes continued until 9 p.m. when troops started firing at the rock-throwing   protesters.
As soldiers continued firing into crowds around Beijing and sprayed a diplomatic   compound with bullets yesterday, foreign embassies ordered their nationals to leave the   city.
By April 17 thousands of students were   marching in Beijing and Shanghai shouting "Long live Hu Yaobang!
Today's killings and flight of hundreds of thousands of protesters from Tiananmen   Square is the outcome of events beginning with the death of former Communist party   chief Hu Yaobang on April 15 this year.
