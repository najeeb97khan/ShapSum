A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck northern Iran.
It is the largest quake ever recorded in   that area, striking an area where most buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely   deposited soil.
The casualty count was pushed up because the   quake struck just after midnight, when people were indoors asleep.
Thursday's quake was   reminiscent of the Dec. 7, 1988 quake which devastated Soviet Armenia.
The soil shifts in an earthquake which caused the fragile ceramic-type   brick or adobe homes to collapse easily.
Scores of villages were destroyed in this   mountainous region of coastal Iran, burying the inhabitants.
The early morning earthquake which struck Iran killed at least 25,000 and injured   thousands of others as they slept on Thursday.
The European Community granted $1.2 million in emergency aid and the U.S. sent   $300,000 worth of relief supplies.
That quake,   which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, killed about 25,000 people.
In addition to supplies, the Soviet Union sent a professional life   saving team from the Armenian capital of Yerevan.
The earthquake is very   similar to one which struck Soviet Armenia on Dec. 7, 1988, and killed 25,000 people.
