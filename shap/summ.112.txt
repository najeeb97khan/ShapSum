Preliminary biopsy showed the polyp to be benign.
The ex-senator is expected to make a full recovery.
Former Senator John Tower, the defense secretary-designate had surgery for  removal of a colon polyp.
Tests of the growth showed it to contain some "malignant but well  differentiated cells".
He has also served as an arms  negotiator for President Reagan and he headed the White House's Iran-contra  investigative panel.
Tower went into business as a defense consultant after he left the Senate in  1985, having served there for 24 years.
An unnamed source stated that  Combest once said Tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch two  or three times a week.
Representative Larry Combest supports his former boss, John Tower, for  Defense Secretary but declined to comment on a published report that Tower  would drink a bottle of scotch at a sitting.
Weyrich says that Tower may lack the  "moral character" to be secretary of defense and cites lack of sobriety and  womanizing.
Statements of loss came from Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Senator Sam  Nunn of Georgia.
The FBI is checking allegations that defense secretary-designee John Tower  was recently involved in an episode of public drunkenness.
