A row has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange and the Securities and Exchange   Board of India (SEBI) over its first inspection of the stockbrokers' books.
SEBI accused   the brokers of ignoring rules and authorities of failing to enforce rules and of poor   administration.
The stock market has fallen 48 percent since early last year including   dropping 320 points after the Indian budget was announced.
The exchange denied the charges and called SEBI heavy handed and   inflexible.
More than a dozen bombs exploded yesterday afternoon in Bombay, killing about 200   and injuring more than a 1,000.
This is just the latest in a series of disputes between SEBI--backed by the   finance minister--and brokers.
Targets included the Bombay Stock   Exchange, Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared to be a   systematic attack on India's commercial heart.
Terror struck India again last night when an explosion destroyed two blocks of   apartments in the center of Calcutta.
The Bombay Stock Exchange, hit by two bombs last Friday, reopened Monday with very   limited trading.
