Over several hours on Thursday Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure fell from 132 over 60   to 112 over 50 and his pulse dropped from 104 per minute to 84, according to Imperial   Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
Hirohito, 87, has been bedridden for a month.
Maeda said the emperor's blood pressure   has returned to its normal level, but that the intestinal hemorrhaging that began a month   ago resumed Thursday and the pace of the discharges was quickening.
United States, New Zealand, Filipino, and Australian leaders mourned Emperor Hirohito,   dead today at 87, but reaction in South Korea and Taiwan was cool.
He has received nearly 22 pints of blood   since his illness worsened Sept. 19.
After his death he was posthumously named Showa, the name he chose for his reign soon   after he became emperor in 1926.
Emperor Hirohito's condition weakened Friday, but doctors speculated that a scab had   stopped internal bleeding, said Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
Emperor Hirohito, 87, will be remembered for his first effective and the most courageous   decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must surrender and end the Pacific conflict in   WW II.
