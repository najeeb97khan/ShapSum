Andrei D. Sakharov, 66, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize.
He was exiled to Gorky for   seven years after criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, returning to Moscow with   his wife Yelena Bonner in December 1986.
Now   press says they live simply.
He vocally supports Gorbachev's   reform campaign but calls for political prisoner liberation and human rights   improvements.
Sakharov belongs to the Academy of   Sciences and helped create the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
His apartment is a mecca   for Soviets seeking his aid.
He will   visit relatives, undergo medical tests, and promote the new International Foundation for   Survival and Development of Humanity, to which he belongs.
Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov began a two-week US visit Sunday.
Past Soviet reports called the couple traitors, accusing Bonner of   marrying Sakharov for his money, and saying they lived in luxury amid scandals.
In New York Thursday, Andrei D. Sakharov, father of the Soviet dissident movement,   received the 1973 Human Rights Award from the International League for Human   Rights.
Moscow News published a special edition devoted to the activist, including   a speech he delivered hours before his death saying the Soviet hierarchy was leading the   country to catastrophe.
