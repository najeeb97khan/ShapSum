In the past the state-run media has branded the dissident couple   as traitors.
The latest issue of the Soviet News included a sensitive article on Andrei Sakharov and   his wife, Yelena Bonner.
He was exiled for criticizing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
He and Yelena live frugally in Moscow.
Sakharov now supports Gorbachev, but wants all political prisoners released.
The article made only indirect mention of Sakharov's forced exile in the   closed city of Gorky.
Sakharov is a member of the prestigious Academy of Sciences and a 1975 Nobel Peace   Prize winner.
Soviet physicists, in a rebuff to the Soviet Union's scientific establishment, voted on   Friday to nominate Andrei Sakharov to be a candidate in the March parliamentary   elections.
Andrei Sakharov was banished without trial to the closed city of Gorky in January 1980.
He was allowed to return to Moscow in December 1986.
The overwhelming vote, taken in secrecy, came only two days after the   Governing Board of the Academy of Sciences rejected Sakharov's candidacy.
Andrei Sakharov's visit to the United States has gone virtually unreported in Moscow,   with only a radio broadcast saying he had voiced opposition to the "Star Wars" program.
