Iraqi and Kuwaiti negotiators met privately in Jiddah on Tuesday to defuse their border   and oil dispute as 100,000 Iraqi troops massed on the border.
Another meeting is   scheduled for Wednesday.
Iraq has historically laid claim to all of Kuwait, and has coveted two Kuwaiti   islands that command Iraq's only access to the Persian Gulf.
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein touched off the crisis on 17 July when he accused   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of exceeding the quotas of oil production set by   OPEC, and said Kuwait was illegally pumping oil from a field that straddles an unmarked   border.
Kuwait   immediately appealed for United States help.
Iraq also alleges that Kuwait was   working in concert with Zionist and colonial powers in plotting against Iraq.
Thursday the   United Nations Security Council condemned the invasion, and on Monday approved   sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq.
Only Yemen abstained.
Oil prices soared in anticipation of a   reduced supply of oil.
United States naval   vessels were diverted toward the Persian Gulf.
The Iraqi News Service said other countries should not take "punishing action" against   Iraq, and in what sounded like a warning, said that countries should remember their   interests and citizens in Kuwait.
