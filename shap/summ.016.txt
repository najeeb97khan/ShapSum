As the U.S. Army band played a song about old Berlin, a crane hoisted the rectangular   white sentry station known as Checkpoint Charlie onto a waiting truck.
For 29 years,   Checkpoint Charlie served as the Allied checkpoint at the only place between the Berlins   that could be crossed on foot by non-Germans.
Citing Checkpoint Charlie as a symbol of   the Cold War, Secretary of State Baker hoped its removal would "bury the conflicts it   created."
In an elaborate ceremony attended by six foreign ministers, numerous generals, a brass   band and hundreds of reporters, Checkpoint Charlie was lifted on to a flatbed truck and   consigned to history.
Checkpoint   Charlie became superfluous last Fall when East Germany overthrew its communist   government and the German borders were opened.
Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze called for the removal of Berlin's status   as an allied controlled city.
Attendance by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, the first visit of a Soviet   foreign minister to Berlin, was seen as a gesture of reconciliation.
One resident said she   saw eight people shot to death attempting to escape and at least 20 successful attempts.
