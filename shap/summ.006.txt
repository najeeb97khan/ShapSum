An explosion at the southern England town of Deal leveled a two-story barracks at the   Royal Marines School of Music and seriously damaged many homes in the   neighborhood.
The band was playing at the time of the explosion and was trapped under   the wreckage.
The blast, an act of the Irish Republican Army, left 11 dead and 22   injured.
An explosion at the Royal Marines School of Music in the southeastern coastal town of   Deal killed eight people and injured 30.
Terrified neighbors, some of whom said the blast reminded them of the Blitz,   were just starting their day when the explosion occurred.
Up to 18 people were feared trapped in the   rubble.
The injured are suffering from injuries typical of an explosion.
The reason for the blast, which occurred at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks is   not known but a forensic team from Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad had been called   in to help investigate.
Police continue to search for three men with Irish accents   who rented a house overlooking the barracks.
Homes were wrecked as roofs   were torn off, ceilings tumbled down and windows were blown out.
