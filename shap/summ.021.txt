The Dog Fanciers Club organized a lunch at Sardi's on Wednesday for two of their   champions, the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog.
Great Elms Prince   Charming II is a fluffy little Pomeranian.
Nero, a big, amiable   bruiser of a German Shepard specializes in sniffing out bombs and narcotics.
Marco, a feisty boxer, walked off with the champion's trophy at Israel's dog-of-the-year   contest held in Tel Aviv's Exhibition Center.
He was named best in show at the prestigious   Westminister Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden last month.
Unfairly,   neither Nero nor Prince got any lunch at this prominent midtown restaurant.
This sanctioned, two-day international   event gave about 20,000 people the opportunity to see about 800 pretty pouches of more   than 50 breeds.
More than 2,500 dogs, representing 118 breeds, will compete at Sunday's All Breed Dog   Show and Obedience Trials at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
The "intefadeh", the word used to describe the 9-month-old wave of Palestinian   violence in Israel, may have drastically reduced this year's foreign competition as   compared with a similar show last year.
