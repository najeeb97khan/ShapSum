President Bush has decided to nominate James Lilley to be ambassador to  China.
Lilley was CIA chief of station in China when Bush headed the US  liaison office there in 1974-1975.
Lilley was born in China of American  parents working there.
Bush's choice for assistant secretary of state for  Latin America, Democrat Bernard Aronson, has raised concern from the two  leading Republican Senators on the Foreign Relations Committee.
Senators  Helms and Lugar have expressed their concerns to Secretary of State Baker.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee endorsed the nomination of Republican  activist Peter Secchia to be ambassador to Italy.
Ronald Spiers, a veteran US diplomat will be the new undersecretary-general  for General Assembly affairs at the UN.
It is unlikely that the senators will block the nomination but will probably  conduct tough questioning during confirmation hearings.
The Bush administration fearing that the nomination of Melissa Wells to be  ambassador to Nicaragua might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight has  decided to name Harry Shlaudeman for the post.
However, most of al-Fanik's column is aimed at  the comments of Senator Daniel Moynihan at Egan's confirmation hearing.
A column by Fahd al-Fanik in Arabic in the Amman AL-RA'Y, notes that the new  US ambassador to Jordan is a heavyweight having served in Cairo, Saudi  Arabia, two African countries, and a European country.
