Authorities charges a ferry captain with negligent homicide after the boat, overcrowded   with New Year's travelers sank off Guatemala' east coast.
The ferry ran out of fuel mid-way in its journey and   sank after a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port.
Fifty-nine   people drowned and 6 are missing.
Sixty-seven people drowned,   14 were missing and 46 survived.
The ferry captain was slow to   respond to requests by the skipper of the naval patrol boat to take control of the ferry's   wheel once it was under tow.
A passenger ferry sank off the coast of Guatemala while being towed to port.
The boat trip is normally used by pilgrims crossing the river   to worship at a Hindu shrine.
The ferry captain radioed that he had taken the wheel just   as the boat began to capsize.
In a single year, four ferry accidents left 320 people dead and at least 8 missing.
The victim was   working with a Spanish technical aid and economic development mission in Guatemala.
The ferry was nearing the end of a   trip from Jiddah, Saudi Arabia and many of the passengers were returning from off   season pilgrimages to Mecca.
