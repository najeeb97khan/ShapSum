Deputy Police Chief Ralph Tribble said that he is in custody.
He then shot himself in   the head.
The attack at Cleveland   Elementary School came shortly before noon.
Eight of those shot   were being treated at St. Joseph's Medical Center and at least 30 people were sent to   other area hospitals, according to Police Chief Jack Calkins.
Police received a call that a man went   berserk with an automatic weapon and several people were down.
Translators were located and sent by the Charterhouse Center   refugee program, which is funded by the Episcopal Church and private donations.
One hospital called for help because its staff with language   skills was overloaded.
