Communism's first taste of a Big Mac occurred with the opening of a McDonald's in   Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
The opening of the first of six McDonald's in Yugoslavia in the   next five years drew large crowds.
Many stood in line for up to three hours to get their   first taste of an American hamburger.
Priced about the same as the Pljeskavica, the Big Mac will be offered in a   setting that discourages lounging, bans smoking and is alcohol free; a sharp contrast to   traditional Balkan dining custom.
The opening may be the beginning of a competition   between the Big Mac and Yugoslavia's traditional hamburger-like fast food, the   Pljeskavica.
In the midst of tough economic times, McDonald's opened its second restaurant in   Moscow as part of a 12 story office block.
The ingredients used at the restaurant are provided by Soviet farms, but   McDonald's provided farmers with special training and disease-resistant seeds for the   process.
To guarantee its supplies, McDonald's built its own factory, including a   bakery, dairy, and meat processing plant; important in a country where up to 25 percent   of the harvest rots en route to the customer.
