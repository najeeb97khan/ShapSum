The Philippine government said it will file criminal charges against former President   Marcos, claiming he stole up to $10 billion of government funds.
Saturday Manila newspapers quoted Teodoro Benigno, President Corazon Aquinoi's press   secretary, saying Mrs. Aquino told Swiss lawyers that Ferdinand Marcos will be allowed   to return to the Philippines so that he can be tried for stealing billions of dollars.
Philippine law prohibits trial in absentia.
Mrs. Aquino, however,   has previously refused to let Marcos return from exile in Hawaii, citing security concerns.
Mrs. Aquino succeeded Marcos after the 1986 uprising that toppled his administration   and forced him into exile in Hawaii.
Abad's stand, alarmed landowners in Congress,   and lawmakers on the Commission on Appointments who belong to the pro-Aquino party   blocked his appointment through eight hearings.
Swiss lawyers are helping the Philippine government trace money that Marcos allegedly   placed in Swiss banks.
Calling   for debt relief and investment, Mrs. Aquino said that under her leadership the country's   growth rate had improved from minus10 percent to plus 6.7 percent.
President Corazon Aquino on Friday refuse to allow her predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos,   to return home to die and won't permit him to be buried here despite an appeal from his   wife.
