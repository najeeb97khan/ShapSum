More US territory suffered some   degree of drought in May and June than at any point on record.
On July 2, 35% of the   contiguous US was experiencing severe to extreme drought, compared to 60% in 1934   and 50% in 1954.
However, there will still be adequate supplies of food grains   and livestock feed to meet domestic and export demands.
Consumption will be less   because prices are higher.

Food aid from developed countries could   also fall.
World cereal production in 1988 is expected to be 1.785 billion tons, only two   million tons more than last year's lower-than-expected production.
North America's crippling drought could result in food shortages for poor, food-  importing countries facing high grain prices.
Because of the extensive early season drought, this year's total affected   area could set new records.
Friday's thunderstorms brought Kansas   tornadoes and Michigan hail.
Carolina and Virginia hay shipments, organized by the stock car world, will be trucked to   Ohio tomorrow.
