A study at the Jefferson Medical   College in Philadelphia showed that laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks,   suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of TGF beta than rats that did not   receive TGF beta.
The TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as   tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack.
Any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with TGF beta is at least a   year away.
A natural substance called transforming growth factor (TGF) beta appears to be able to   limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.
In one study, there were 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the   11,000 subjects taking aspirin, compared with 2 strokes in the 11,000 taking a substitute.
Diliazen, a calcium entry blocker, is one of a new class of drugs   in the fight against heart disease.
When groups who underwent angioplasty were compared to groups   who received TPA and only those with lingering heart pain or other symptoms underwent   angioplasty, there was no difference in survival rates.
Deaths from heart and blood vessel disease dropped 24% over the past decade.
