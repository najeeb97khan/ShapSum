The newspaper was not identified but there is speculation that it might be The New York Daily   News, which is struggling to restore profitability; USA Today, which would mesh with   Maxwell's efforts for the new paper The European; or the Chicago Sun-Times that has been   sliding in circulation since 1985.
British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell, who publishes Britain's Daily Mirror, said Monday   he is involved in negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper worth "hundreds of millions of dollars."
Following his takeover of the unprofitable New York Daily News, British publisher Robert   Maxwell plans to raise about #250 million ($448 million) through the sale of shares in his Mirror   Group Newspaper Ltd. of Britain.
Officials of each of these newspapers denied they were negotiating with Maxwell, who recently   bought three US tabloids: the Globe, National Examiner, and the Sun.
Mirror's flagship publication is the tabloid Daily Mirror.
The Czechoslovak-born Maxwell, who escaped the Holocaust and immigrated to Britain in 1940,   personally ran his own publishing empire.
Michael Stoney, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, and Kevin and Ian   Maxwell, the sons of the late Robert Maxwell, are named as the three top persons involved in at   least 28 "unusual" payments from Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) bank accounts.
