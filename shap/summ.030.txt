In studies with rats induced to have heart attacks, those rats receiving injections of TGF   beta had 50 percent less cell damage than those not receiving the injections.
According to a study published in the journal Science, cardiac cell damage following a   heart attack may be limited by a natural substance called transforming growth factor beta.
Many doctors still are not using   clot-dissolving drugs but it is felt that, in the future, their use will be considered safe   enough to allow paramedics to administer them to patients on the way to the hospital.
A study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that an   intestinal operation to lower cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced the risk of a   second heart attack.
The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the   amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue.
Hearts damaged by a heart attack tended to   lose creatine kinase.
Although the death rate from heart attacks and blood vessels diseases has dropped 24   percent in the last decade, they remain the number one cause of death in the United   States.
