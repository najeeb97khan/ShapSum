Greek divers located the remains of a wooden sailing vessel on 3 May 1988.
More than 1,000, including 400 Greeks, were aboard the Turkish ship.
The Turkish vessel was identified as the Bourloti Seimaz, or translated as "Explosives   Invincible".
The vessel   was found near Chios, a Greek island in the eastern Aegean Sea, where a Greek naval   vessel sank a Turkish warship on 7 June 1882.
The ship was   crammed with loot taken from Chios.
It was returning from raiding and killing thousands of Greeks on Chios.
The Greek divers hope to interest American and Turkish  experts to help in recovering the vessel.
The ship sank   about 12:45 P.M. in high winds.
