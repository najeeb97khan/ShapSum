Tanglewood is also celebrating the   50th anniversary of its Music Shed.
Beverly Sills will be host and the resident Boston Pops Orchestra will play Bernstein's,   classical and popular masterpieces.
He was a member of the Tanglewood class of 1940.
His whimsical "Candide"   and eclectic "Serenade", with soloist Glenn Dicterow, lightened the mourning mood.
Stars will attend the August 70th birthday bash for conductor Leonard Bernstein at the   Tanglewood Music Center, where he got his start.
Tickets run from $20 to $5,000 to benefit the music center and Bernstein's fund for   young conductors.
The four-day Bernstein gala begins on August 25.
Conductors who were mentored by Bernstein will direct the Boston   Symphony, the Boston Pops Orchestra, and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus.
Performers include Lauren Bacall, Betty Comden,   Phyllis Newman, Dame Gwyneth Jones, Frederica von Stade, and Barbara Hendricks.
The shimmering performance, the 1,215th time   he conducted this orchestra, consisted of three Bernstein compositions--"Chichester   Psalms", a serenade, and a symphony.
Arthur Laurents, the librettist for "West Side Story", was   host.
Bernstein's landmark opera recordings will also be honored.
Beverly Sills, Lauren Bacall, Betty Comden, and Phyllis Newman will appear at the   Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance in August.
