The major earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region   targeted from previous studies by seismologists as having the highest probability of a strong   quake in North California.
Initial reports indicated widespread damage from the quake, especially affecting highways and   old masonry buildings.
The quake's magnitude as 6.9 on the Richter scale and centered in the   Santa Cruz, CA area 75 miles south of San Francisco.
A violent earthquake registering 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked Northern California Tuesday at   5:04 pm.
A major fire was burning in San Francisco's Marina District.
It could serve as an engineering study for any possible damage in the Los   Angles region, which has similar construction and a higher probability of a major quake   occurring.
Los Angles shipped doctors, sonic equipment, and fire investigators;   Charleston, SC and a California brewery sent drinking water; the Salvation Army provided   cooked food canteens; the Red Cross blood units and shelters; and the Coast Guard boats and   helicopters.
One report said the quake was centered near Hollister, 80 miles southeast of San   Francisco in San Benito County.
