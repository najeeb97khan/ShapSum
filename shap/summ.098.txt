Greek divers have found the remains of a Turkish warship, the Bourloti  Seimaz, in the eastern Aegean near the island of Chios.
The Greeks had rammed the Turkish ship with  a boatload of explosives.
Greek  revolutionaries had sunk the ship in 1822 in revenge for Turkish killing and  looting on Chios.
Thousands died in Chios and this action put European  countries behind the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman  Empire, which they won in 1830.
The sinking occurred off the Dutch coast near the island of  Ameland.
The Greeks escaped the explosion that killed the  Ottoman commander.
The remains of the ship lie under 162 feet of water  making recovery difficult.
The incident occurred about 15 nautical miles off the coast of Malvinas so  the Argentine ship transferred assistance responsibility to British  authorities in accordance with bilateral agreements.
Argentine officials doubted  further spilling since the ship's fuel and that being taken to the Argentine  Esperanza station were in steel drums.
Leaks from the  ship killed some krill, a vital part of the food chain, and any further  leaks would constitute an ecological disaster.
Structural evidence and the ship sitting upright convinced Ballard of the  scuttling rather than the British sinking it.
