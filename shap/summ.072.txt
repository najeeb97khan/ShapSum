Launch is scheduled for 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
The countdown began Saturday for launching of Space Shuttle Discovery on its mission   of hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) into orbit above the earth's atmosphere.
The $1.5 billion telescope is expected   to start providing significant scientific data in a month or two.
It may   help test the theory arising from the work of Edwin P. Hubble, for whom it is named,   that the ever expanding universe was created by a tremendous explosion some 15   billion years ago.
Astronomers were jubilant as the space shuttle Discovery lifted off carrying the Hubble   Space Telescope into orbit, putting an end to seven years of delays caused by   technical problems and the Challenger explosion.
Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles   behind the HST and was to stay nearby until the Hubble's aperture door is opened   Friday morning.
HST is considered to be   the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609.
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) orbited with its lens cover open Friday, but its   electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.
