Late this afternoon   the water level at the Changsha monitoring station had risen to 38.93 meters, some 0.56   meters higher than ever previously recorded.
The water level is still rising sharply.
Floods have hit Changsha, the capital of central China's Hunan Province following a   succession of rainstorms in the upper and middle Xiangjiang River.
So far, more than 500,000 soldiers and local residents are fighting the floods.
Communist Party officials urge perseverance.
Yesterday afternoon 19 dykes in the Changsha area collapsed affecting 128,000 residents.
The Changsha city government has asked those in the endangered area to move to safer   places.
They expressed their   hope that under the leadership of the Guangdong provincial party committee and   government, people would make concerted efforts to help flood victims solve their living   problems, and go all out to battle the floods to ensure the safety of the Bei Jiang dike,   Guangzhou city and the Zhu Jiang Delta.
They gave important directives   for current flood prevention and disaster relief tasks in Guangdong.
At Wuzhou, a city on the Xunjiang River, the   floodwater's speed was recorded at 46,200 cubic-meters-per-second, the most ferocious   since the founding of New China in 1949.
