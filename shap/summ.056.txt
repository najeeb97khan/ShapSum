Philippine President Corazon Aquino has agreed to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return so   that he can be prosecuted for stealing billions of dollars.
She has refused   to allow Marcos, in exile in Hawaii, back into the Philippines, citing security reasons.
He   was ousted in a 1986 coup and is accused of stealing $10 billion, much of it allegedly   deposited in Swiss bank accounts.
Manila newspapers reported   today, that she told this to lawyers in Switzerland when she visited there.
President Corazon Aquino said today she will not allow ousted leader Ferdinand Marcos   to return home to die or allow his body to be buried in the Philippines.
Marcos is in   critical condition in a Honolulu hospital suffering from renal, cardiac, and pulmonary   failure.
Although the Swiss government has frozen these   funds, Swiss law allows secrecy requirements to be lifted only for a criminal prosecution.
His wife, Imelda, and his lawyer are appealing for his return.
Philippine President Corazon Aquino quickly responded to the most recent coup attempt.
Friday, President Corazon Aquino refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the   Philippines to die or permit his body to be buried here.
