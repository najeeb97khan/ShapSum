The announcement of Gorbachev's illness and a  palace coup provides a starting point for speculation.
Kremlinologists who look for conspiracies are working overtime on recent  events in the Soviet Union.
Russian President  Boris Yeltsin was not arrested.
Could it be that  Gorbachev has co-opted the coup?
According to the theory,  Gorbachev did not  want any bloodshed.
Tanks did not roll until hours after  Gorbachev's supposed arrest and it was said that many of the tanks that  surrounded the Parliament building had no ammunition.
Gorbachev praised Boris Yeltsin for  his role in halting the coup.
Even Eduard Shevardnadze, a longtime ally of Gorbachev,  considered the possibility that he was behind the activities.
The three-day coup was one of the most  tumultuous events in recent history and its failure could be a fatal blow to  efforts to thwart reform drives by Gorbachev and Yeltsin.
Yeltsin was clearly in control of the situation and Gorbachev's position was  weakening drastically.
In a symbol of the new order, the  Russian tricolor now flies beside the Soviet red flag at the Kremlin gate.
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said the failed power grab by hard-liners  could prove to be an opportunity to further his democratic reforms.
