Today, Iraq struck back by rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait as the   U.N. Security Council overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions   to punish it for invading Kuwait.
The Kuwaiti Embassy announced on Wednesday that Iraqi troops had launched an   offensive against Kuwait.
Today's fighting sent oil prices surging in international markets.
Kuwait and U.S. diplomats labeled the coup a farce.
Earlier, Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its Kuwaiti   border after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the OPEC cartel   had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's revenue, and that Kuwait had been   stealing oil from a field that straddles the border.
On Tuesday, John Kelly, a State   Department spokesman, told a House subcommittee that the United States has no treaty   obligations mandating military support for Kuwait; however, we do believe strongly in   respect for territories of all states in the region.
Iraq claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this small, oil-rich kingdom.
Kuwait's U.N. ambassador said that   the Iraqi-installed government was employing "pure blackmail" by saying it could not   ensure the safety of foreigners if their governments support sanctions.
