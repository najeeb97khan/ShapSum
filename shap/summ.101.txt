The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accuses the Bombay stock   exchange of flouting regulations including those designed to limit excessive speculative   investments.
The exchange denies the allegations, but the dispute does nothing to   stimulate the stock market where shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early   last year.
This week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which date from   SEBI's creation a year ago.
Unlike the riots that racked the city last December, Friday's attack was   clearly high-technology terrorism carried out with Semtex plastic explosives, high-grade   timers, efficient organization and money.
The   finance minister is backing SEBI to the hilt and singled it out for praise in his recent   budget message.
Despite a bomb attack last Friday,  the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) reopened   Monday with the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent by Tuesday.
India suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion in the crowded trade   and residential district of Bowbazaar in Calcutta destroyed two blocks of flats killing at   least 45 people and injuring scores more.
