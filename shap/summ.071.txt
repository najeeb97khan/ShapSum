A hurricane   warning was posted for Fernandina Beach, Fla., to Oregon Inlet, N.C. About three hours later the eye of the storm, 10 miles across and   with top winds at 135 mph, passed over the Isle of Palms east of Charleston.
Harris declared a state of emergency in six counties.
Late Thursday there was hope that Hugo might miss Charleston, but the storm   gathered strength as it slammed into the city packing 135 mph winds.
National Hurricane Center forecasters used computer models to track Hugo's path   into Charleston, giving people time to evacuate the South Carolina coast.
The worst natural disaster to beset the city   ever occurred on Aug. 32, 1886, when an earthquake measuring 7.7 on the Richter   scale struck, claiming 110 lives and destroying 102 buildings.
A Red Cross spokesman said   that it was sheltering thousands of evacuees and resources were very strained.
